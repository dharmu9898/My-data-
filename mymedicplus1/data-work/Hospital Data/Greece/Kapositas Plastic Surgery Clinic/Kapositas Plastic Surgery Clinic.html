      Operation:Upper-Lower Eyelid Surgery (blepharoplasty)</p>
      <p>Mr Kapositas has OPENED my eyes to the world of Plastic Surgery...In more ways than one!!!<br />
        9 days ago I underwent an upper and lower eyelift and already the bruising has gone and people are noticing a difference. I am so pleased to have found Mr Kapositas and would recommend him to anyone. </p>
      <p>He has a lovely demeanour and intstantly puts you at ease. The procedure was painless and the results are amazing already. It was really nice to meet a Doctor in Greece who treats you like a person, not another faceless name on their books. </p>
      <p>Anyone considering an eyelift - look no further, Mr Kapostitas is THE BEST<br />
      </p>
      <p><br /><strong>Name:A.M</strong><br />
        Country:UK &amp;Ireland<br />
      Operation: Face &amp; neck Lift/Breast reduction- Lift</p>
      <p>I was worried that a Face Lift would took un-natural,but I am delighted with the results,and I would recommend the procedure to anyone else who has doubts.</p>
      <p>The surgical care was also excellent-I believe much better than I would have received in the U.K.The breast reduction/lift was carried out to a similarly high standard and I am delighted with the results.But, most of all, I appreciated the caring nature of Dr Kapositas and his staff.If there is anyone else who is considering similar procedures I&beta;&euro;&trade;d be happy to talk with them.<br />
      <br />

      <p>I was very impressed by Dr Kapositas as the consultation was excellent, explained everything very well and put me at ease about my operations going into detail exactly what procedures would take place. Dr Kapositas exceed my expectations and I was absolutely delighted with the results of the augmentation and face lift. I would totally recommend him for his expertise and of his high standards for aftercare. I am certain I will be back for more procedures.<br />
