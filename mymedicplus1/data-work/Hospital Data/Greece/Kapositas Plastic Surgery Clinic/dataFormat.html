      <p><strong>OPERATION:<span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </span>Breast reduction/breast lift</strong></p>
      <p>Ok, here are my true feelings! <br />
        Well, DR. KAPOSITAS, you must be a magical human being because of the  trust I felt in you! I live in Los Angeles and it took me 3 years to  find and trust the right plastic surgeon. <br />
        I even went to an appointment for a consultation and I got cold feet.  Visiting Greece, I mentioned your name to a cousin of mine and she  recommended you right away, since she had a friend that had done an  eyelid surgery (Blepharoplasty) and knew your name from TV, anyway. I  wanted to have the breast reduction, so bad!! I didn't even ask you  that many questions and I knew you would take care of what I needed. I  liked feeling confident about you, I felt you were thoughtful, direct,  human on top of professional and I liked your smile and humor.!  So, I arrived at the clinic. </p>
      <p>Everyone there was great! All the tests went quick and the next  thing I know I'm at the surgery table. No anxiety! I knew you'd perform  the miracle I wanted so much! And you did!  Recovery was easy too. The pain was bearable, and minimal. </p>
      <p>Now, I'm able to wear all kinds of cute tops and dresses again! I feel good, I look good and it's thanks to you! </p>
      <p>I'd recommend you again, and again. Thank you so much, Dr. Kapositas!</p>

      <p><strong>NAME: GV</strong></p>
      <p><strong>OPERATION: Breast augmentation</strong></p>
      <p>Well, where shall I begin.... <br />
        I am married and have one son. <br />
        I had a major complex about me being flat chested, I never wore dresses, I could   never buy langerie that I liked, I used to buy bras\' with silicone sowed into   them, till one day that bra started to leak, I didn't feel anything, till   I went to the bathroom and saw in the mirror a wet patch right under my left   breast, I felt terrrible, I didn't know where to put my face, I asked for   one hour leave from work, thank goodness I lived close by, went home, got   changed, but that was when I got angry, really frustrated about me being flat   chested, having to wear this silicone bra with 35 degrees outside, that\'s when   I had a discussion with my husband, I told him I was thinking of having breast   augmentation done, and he offered to make it a gift for me. <br />
  <br />
        That\'s when the research started, I had a lot of fears, the dangers involving   such surgeries, hearing of different situations which had a negative result in   the end. I was determined to see for myself, after a whole lot of research, I   accidently got linked to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery   site, which got me to find Dr. Kapositas in Greece, I was relieved that I found   a plastic surgeon who was highly qualified. I arranged for an appointment, he   saw me, he got rid of all my doubts, by answering alot of questions, he even let   me see a patient of his, which had breast augmentation done. <br />
  <br />
        I went through with the procedure, it felt good looking down and seeing that I   have what I always desired, something truly feminine, something that I was   always envious of. <br />
  <br />
        After a few weeks from surgery, a friend came up to me, not knowing that I had   done the surgery, thinking that she could stop me in time ,she told me to get   into a link, which I didn't see, this site talked about another women who   had breast augmentation done, somewhere in the States, and it showed all the   dangers that silicone does to the body, dreadful photos taken of women\'s   breasts who had undergone breast augmentation, and what they went through to get   their body healthy agian...God, I was so shocked, I paniced, I had these things   in me?. I printed all this info I had found and went to Dr. Kapositas. <br />
  <br />
        I went into his office full of tears in my eyes, scared of what will happen to   me, I took out all the printed info, which was quite a few, I dropped it onto   his desk, and told him with fear in my eyes, that if I was going to turn out   like the photos, I wanted the silicones out of me....now! <br />
  <br />
        He tried to calm me down, he assured me that these problems, were when silicone   first started getting used for breast augmentations, that there was no way   something like that would happen to me. <br />
  <br />
        I felt better once having Dr. Kapositas <br />
        talk openly to me, he hugged me and told me to throw all that printout into the   rubbish where it belonged. As I left his office,that\'s exactly what I did. <br />
  <br />
        Now 8 months after my surgery, I am not only feeling better about my appearance,   being very pleased with been able to wear what I want, I am healthy. <br />
        From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank Dr. Kapositas for been so   professional yet so humanly too. <br />
  <br />
        Thank You for changing the way I feel about my body and how natural they look. <br />
        Which ever women is thinking of undergoing breast augmentation...Dr. Kapositas   is the way to do it! <br />
  <br />

      <p>Do you remember when i first came into your office ? I had already   gone to see a few surgeons before you and bombarded you with so many   questions. You were of course very cool under my pressuring   inquisitiveness. Your expertise became as clearly evident as your   kindness and patience, and sensitivity.</p>
      <p>You are gifted and have a wonderful talent. I'm very pleased with what   you did in forming the new me &quot;that definitely took talent&quot; Its only   been a week since my TT &amp; MR and the difference is breath catching, and   continuing to see myself improve. This surgery was much easier than i   thought, my friends can see a big difference in me i have become the   person that i was many years ago..</p>
      <p>I want to thank you for all your kindness and expertise, thoughtfulness,  patience and most of all for being the wonderful person that you   are.<br />
        From the very first moment you made me feel complete at ease. You were   understanding, compassionate and polite and   unobtrusive I felt totally safe in your care as well as the care of the   clinic they went far beyond my expectations and I thank you for   regarding me as a person and not just a faceless &quot;chart&quot; by listening   respecting and performing top quality surgery.</p>
      <p>You have made a big difference in my life and I'm glad I had you as my   surgeon, and now you are a special person in my life and your name will   be spoken with kindness and to all my friends who are wanting surgery   done your name is at the top of the list.</p>
      <p>Thank you Very much Nodas Its hard to find the words to tell you the   difference that you have made in my life.</p>

        I had a breast reduction in January of this year (2008) and I am so thrilled   with the results. From the consultation right through to the hospital care I   could not fault the kindness and procedures throughout the whole experience. Dr   Kapositas was very patient while I asked endless questions and was very   reassuring so that I had no worries about the operation both before or after. I   was surprised at how little pain I had and wished that I had had a reduction   years ago. I used to suffer from neck and back pain and that has now vanished I   am much more confident about my posture too. <br />
        Thank you Dr Kapositas and staff - I do not hesitate to recommend you. </p>

      <p>Mr Kapositas has OPENED my eyes to the world of Plastic Surgery...In   more ways than one!!!</p>

      <p>He has a   lovely demeanour and intstantly puts you at ease. The procedure was   painless and the results are amazing already. It was really nice to meet   a Doctor in Greece who treats you like a person, not another faceless   name on their books. </p>

        <br />
        The surgical care was also excellent-I believe much better than I would   have received in the U.K.The breast reduction/lift was carried out to a   similarly high standard and I am delighted with the results.But, most of   all, I appreciated the caring nature of Dr Kapositas and his staff.If   there is anyone else who is considering similar procedures I&beta;&euro;&trade;d be happy   to talk with them.<br />

        <p>My overall experience was excellent and I will recommend Dr   Kapositas to my friends back in the UK and Come back if I need   more surgery.</p>
