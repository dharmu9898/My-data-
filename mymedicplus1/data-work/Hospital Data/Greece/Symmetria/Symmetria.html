      <p><strong>Surgical procedures</strong>:</p>
      <p><strong>Breast Augmentation</strong><br />
        The skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall are stretched during pregnancy and whilst in some people this returns to normal, in the majority of cases some loose skin and some abdominal wall muscle weakness will remain. It can be performed at any age after the breasts are fully developed. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Breast Reduction</strong><br />
        Breast reduction, also called reduction mammaplasty, is an operation used to reduce the size of a breast and to uplift it at the same time. It can be performed at any age after the breasts are fully developed. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Breast Uplift</strong><br />
        Breast uplift, also called mastopexy is an operation used to change the shape of a breast and to uplift it at the same time. The saggy breast is reshaped to bring the nipple in a more prominent position at the highest point of the breast. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Gynecomastia</strong><br />
        Gynecomastia is excessive development of the male breast. This can be due to the enlargement of the breast tissue, excessive collection of fat tissue, or a combination of the above. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Liposuction</strong><br />
        Liposuction is a technique to remove unwanted fat deposits from specific areas of the body, including the chin and neck; the upper arms, the abdomen, buttocks, hips and thighs. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Eyelid Surgery</strong><br />
        The eyes and the area immediately around them are particularly important in establishing a first impression when meeting other people. This is often the area that betrays the first signs of ageing, which is particularly evident in the upper eyelid. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>MACS Facelift</strong><br />
        In recent years, technology has transformed the practice of facial plastic surgery. Less aggressive procedures are gaining in popularity with patients demanding subtle but significant results with low risk and rapid return to a normal lifestyle.<br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Necklift</strong><br />
        Gravity, sun exposure, modern life stress, smoking and genetic disposition are responsible for the first signs of ageing, which are more obvious on face and neck. Skin loosens, muscles relax, wrinkles and folds occur, giving a 'sad and tired' look. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ear Surgery (Otoplasty)</strong><br />
        When the ears are not positioned close enough to the head or they are of bigger size to the normal they look protruding and asymmetric to the face and head. The operation to correct this deformity is otoplasty and is usually performed on children up to 14 years old as ears are almost fully grown. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Nose Surgery (Rhinoplasty)</strong><br />
        The nose is one of the most important and prominent of all of facial features and a very complicated facial feature structurally. Its contribution to the aesthetic appearance of the face is immense, both in desirable and undesirable characteristics. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Non surgical procedures</strong>:</p>
      <p><strong>Botox</strong><br />
        Botox is a simple, non-surgical, physician-administered treatment that can temporarily smooth moderate to severe frown lines between the brows in people from 18 to 65 years of age. Botox is in fact a purified protein produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacterium, which reduces the activity of the muscles that cause those frown lines between the brows to form over time.</p>
      <p><strong>Chemical Peels</strong><br />
        As a result of the ageing process, skin undergoes a number of changes. With time, it thins, falls, and creases along muscular and gravitational folds. <br />
        </p>
      <p><strong>Fillers</strong><br />
        One of the earliest signs of aging is a loss of facial fullness and the development of expression lines or soft wrinkles that appear as a result of a repeated facial muscle movement. Softening of these facial lines and the restoration of volume and fullness in the face can be achieved non-surgically with inject able fillers.<br />
