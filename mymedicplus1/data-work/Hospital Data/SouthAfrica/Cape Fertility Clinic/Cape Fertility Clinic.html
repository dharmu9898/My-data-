    <td><p>The <strong>Cape Fertility Clinic</strong> was established in 1993. It is situated in Cape Town, South Africa, one of the most beautiful cities worldwide.</p>
      <p>A modern sophisticated laboratory allows all the latest assisted conception techniques to be used with great success. There are approximately 850 IVF (in vitro fertilization) cycles performed each year. It is one of the largest IVF centers in South Africa.</p>
      <p>We provide a friendly, caring environment to help couples cope with fertility treatment. Our IVF coordinator and a psychologist are available to provide additional counseling. Our premises are purpose built within an IVF operating theatre, laboratory and embryo transfer room all adjacent to our main reception and staff offices. </p></td>

    <td><p>We have designed our program at the <strong>Cape fertility Clinic</strong> around minimal medical intervention to offer a safe and effective service to our patients. We aim to reduce disruption to our patients' lives during a stressful time. Our Fertility Specialists oversee and direct their own patient's medical treatment, and care for their own patients during procedures. However we work in a team, and all difficult problems are discussed within the team.</p>
    <p>The laboratory is equipped with the newest high-magnification ICSI microscope. This helps the embryologist in selecting the best spermatozoa. High-magnification ICSI can improve clinical outcomes in couples with previous repeated conventional ICSI failures</p>
    <p>All Assisted Reproduction procedures are performed at the premises of the Cape Fertility Clinic. Laparoscopical and Hysteroscopical procedures are performed at Kingsbury Hospital. This is located across the street from the Cape Fertility Clinic.</p>
