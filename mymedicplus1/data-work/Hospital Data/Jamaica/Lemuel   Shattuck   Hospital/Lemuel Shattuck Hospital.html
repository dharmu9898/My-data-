    <td><p>The   <strong>Lemuel   Shattuck   Hospital</strong>   provides acute, subacute, and ambulatory care to patients referred primarily by public agencies and private health care providers. This fully accredited teaching facility also provides an array of mental health, substance abuse and social services. </p>
    <p>The hospital&rsquo;s services enable patients that are economically and socially disadvantaged, and underserved by the mainstream health care system to obtain high quality, cost-effective care from a staff that respects their dignity. </p></td>

    <td><p>In addition to operating 255 inpatient beds, the Shattuck is unique among state-operated direct care facilities in offering comprehensive medical care, including 26 subspecialty outpatient clinics, all but the most tertiary surgical services, and a full array of radiological imaging and clinical laboratory services. The hospital&rsquo;s inpatient services play a major role in filling gaps in the health care system for individuals in state care and custody, and from the community, whose co-morbidities and psycho-social issues can be a challenge to conventional health care providers.</p>
      <p> In particular, the hospital&rsquo;s collaboration with the <strong>Massachusetts Department of Mental Health and Department of Correction </strong>enable the chronically and severely mentally ill,  and state and county inmates, to obtain high quality care in a safe and secure setting.</p>
    <p>Multiply diagnosed individuals can obtain one-stop shopping from the breadth and depth of Shattuck&rsquo;s clinical services. This quality of care is enhanced by the hospital&rsquo;s numerous relationship&rsquo;s with academic teaching programs, especially the medical residency program co-sponsored with the Tufts University School of Medicine.</p></td>
