    <td><p><strong>16 YEARS OF INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN TRANSPLANTATION OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC/FETAL STEM CELLS</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Welcome to Cell Therapy Clinic EmCell</strong></p>
<p>Our clinic offers embryonic stem cell treatment in vivo to help people improve their health. Over 16 years, we treated thousands of patients with various diseases, such as diabetes mellitus of types 1 and 2, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and other types of muscular dystrophy, cancer, blood diseases and many others, including rare genetic and hereditary diseases, and conditions (aging, male and female climax). We performed more than 5 000 transplantations of embryonic stem cells to patients from different countries, such as the USA, Italy, Germany, China, Poland etc. Our treatment helped to save and prolong life as well as improve quality of life of thousands of patients. It is effective for restoration of different organs and tissues, and we were able to prove that embryonic stem cells can ignite hope in many people with incurable diseases.</p>
<p>Embryonic tissues center EmCell is a private limited liability company (LLC) founded in 1994.  15 years of intensive work won EmCell team international recognition in the field of research and clinical application of embryonic stem cells (ESC) in vivo. </p>
      <p>At present, this highly efficient and creative team is made of like-minded professionals guided by Prof. Alexander Ivanovich Smikodub who use ESC in vivo, work out indications and contraindications for the treatment of severe acquired and genetic diseases caused by or resulting in cell count reduction.</p>
      <p>History</p>

        2004 	2 Ukrainian patents and 1 patent of Russian Federation were granted</p>
      <p>Cell Therapy Clinic</p>
      <p>Cell Therapy Clinic of the National Medical University of Ukraine and Embryonic Tissues Center EmCell was founded on September 9, 1994 and has been operating for 15 years in spite of changes in legislation and adoption of the new by-laws.  In all these years, we treated thousands of patients from different countries of the world and performed more than 5 000 transplantations of ESC and embryonic tissues.  Our methods helped to save and prolong life of hundreds of patients, restore different organs and tissues and demonstrate that many people with incurable diseases could be helped with ESC.</p>
      <p>In its program aired on November 17, 2005, BBC called our facility the Last Hope Clinic because for 15 years we treated and followed-up the most complex clinical cases.  Apart from this, clinic offers effective prevention and anti-aging programs.</p>
      <p>Biotechnology of stem cell isolation and storage</p>
      <p>EmCell and clinic professionals use modern methods of stem cell isolation and storage.  These methods were patented in different countries of the world, including USA and Holland.  They make embryonic cell suspensions, test them and use them for clinical purposes, therefore each professional combines working in sterile box with clinical practice.  We are of the opinion that transplantation of the material created at the clinic to the patient is the best option.</p>
      <p>Biotechnological stages of work with embryonic material:</p>
      <p>1. Timely, safe, and ethically approved collection of high quality embryonic material in   gynecological departments;</p>
      <p>2. Preparation of embryonic cell cultures and putting them into sterile containers;</p>
      <p>3. Safety and viability testing of embryonic cell suspensions;</p>
      <p>4. Cryopreservation of embryonic tissues at low temperatures;</p>
      <p>5. Safety and viability testing of defrosted embryonic cell suspensions;</p>
      <p>6. Long-term storage of embryonic cell suspensions in cryobanks.</p>
      <p>Cell suspension bank</p>
      <p>Stem suspension bank has always been an important issue for EmCell: modern dewars and tanks containing more than 10 000 embryonic, fetal, cord blood cell suspensions as well as human and experimental animal tissues.  Containers and media are regularly tested for infections and fungi.</p>
      <p>Patents</p>
      <p>Patenting has always been regarded as one of EmCell priorities.  We were the first in the world to describe post-transplantation period after ESC treatment of such diseases as AIDS/HIV, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, aplastic anemia, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative diseases of nervous system, inflammatory and cancer bowel diseases etc.  In 1994, International Patent Application Examination Board in the Hague awarded them level &ldquo;A&rdquo;, or absolutely pioneer works. </p>
      <p>In our patents we mentioned the possibility of treatment of the large number of diseases and conditions caused by or resulting in cell count reduction. We take pride in our US and Dutch patents.  The total number of patents owned by EmCell team is 16, and several patents are pending in US and other countries.</p>
      <p>We were the first in the world to offer ESC-based medicinal preparations and mentioned this in our US, Dutch, Russian and Ukrainian patents.  We believe that sales of ESC-based medicinal preparations in specialized pharmacies for domiciliary or hospital treatment will become possible in this century.</p>
      <p>This will create the grounds for the development of the new ideology of practical medicine when medical professional will issue prescription for cell composite consisting of HLA-free stem cells for treatment of illness- or age-related cell deficiency.</p>
      <p>We welcome cooperation for the development of this idea!</p>
      <p>We own trademark EmCell registered in USA, Russia and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Science</p>
      <p>We work in the field of CELL THERAPY, and our definition of this branch of science is science about stem cells and their clinical use. </p>
      <p>It was in 1990&rsquo;s that we realized that this was the science of the method.  If disease or condition is caused by or results in cell count reduction (main indication), cell therapy can be applied.</p>
      <p>Almost all severe acquired and genetic diseases cause destruction of actively functioning cells and scar tissue formation.  Stem cells capable of proliferation (multiplication), differentiation (specialization) and morphogenesis (tissue formation) are effective for tissue function and cell count restoration. </p>
      <p>The best source of stem cells is embryonic tissue, because its cells have the highest proliferative potential.  Our first clinical transplantations demonstrated unique effectiveness of this method.  Positive effects were reported by patients with severe agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. </p>
      <p>We always collect all the available medical records from the patients and study it carefully.  In 1992-1993 we filed patent applications understanding that we were the first in the world to describe post-transplantation period in different diseases.  Since 1991, 7 MMS theses were written by post-graduate students and staff of the Therapy Chair of the National Medical University of Ukraine for whom Prof. A.I. Smikodub was scientific advisor. </p>
      <p>The scope of our scientific interests was increasing all the time and included treatment methods for type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, AIDS/HIV, leukosis, aplastic anemia, primary and secondary thrombocytopenia, cytostatic myelodepression, cancer diseases, degenerative diseases of central nervous system, multiple sclerosis, ALS, muscular dystrophies, such conditions as climax, infertility and aging, as well as functional disturbances of internal organs and chronic fatigue syndrome. </p>
    <p>We regularly attend international and national scientific events where we present our posters, reports and lectures and so far took part in 40 international and 45 national conferences and congresses.</p></td>
