    <td><p><strong>About us</strong></p>
      <p>Behind the ultra modern and internationally acclaimed in extending world class medical services which are offered at P. D. Hinduja National Hospital &amp; Medical Research Centre, lies a 50 years old dream.</p>
      <p>A mission to assimilate the finest in medical and surgical talent and technique, to bring them closer to the common man. It was nurtured in the heart of our great founder, Shri Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja &ndash; a hard working philanthropist who laid the foundation of the National Hospital, way back in 1951. Today, the P. D. Hinduja National Hospital stands as a concrete testimony to the fulfilment of his dream.</p>
      <p>Hinduja Hospital is an ultramodern multi specialty tertiary care hospital with a Medical Research Centre in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston. The hospital has an inpatient capacity of 351 beds inclusive of 53 critical care beds in different specialities. As a tertiary care hospital, the services offered are comprehensive covering investigation &amp; diagnosis to therapy, surgery &amp; post - operative care. The inpatient services are complemented with a day centre, out-patient facilities and an exclusive centre for health check for executives. Hinduja Hospital was the first multi disciplinary tertiary care hospital to have been awarded the prestigious ISO 9002 Certification from KEMA of Netherlands for Quality Management System. Hinduja Hospital was recently awarded the prestigious &lsquo;Golden Peacock Global Award for Philanthropy in Emerging Economies 2006&rsquo;</p>
      <p><strong>History</strong></p>
      <p>The situation faced by Bombay in the aftermath of India's partition was grim due to the influx of refugees. Sanitation in the crowded camps was poor.</p>
      <p>Health problems had multiplied. It was beyond the ability of city's public hospitals to cope with the situation. Provision of essential health care facility to the ailing poor thus became the need of the hour.</p>
      <p>It was at this crucial juncture that a band of Sindhi philanthropists under the leadership of the late Shri Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja came forward to extend a helping hand.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Mr.Parmanand Hinduja pooled resources and set-up an outdoor clinic the 'Seth Deepchand Gangaram Hinduja Health Care' in December 1951 in Dubash House, a rented building on Cadell Road (now Veer Savarkar Marg), to cater primarily, to the needs of the refugees.</p>
      <p>A few motivated doctors from the Sindhi community formed the core of the medical faculty. It had elementary outpatient facilities and its own dispensary. Just a year later, in February 1953, the 'National Hospital' came into being with 30 beds; the bed strength gradually went upto 70.</p>
      <p>To make the hospital's management broad based, it was handed over to the National Health &amp; Education Society' after the Society was formed and registered under the Public Trusts Act.</p>

      <p>All &lsquo;MY&rsquo; sisters (Nurses) are excellent. They have been so helpful, caring and affectionate, that I seriously have no words to thank them for everything they did for me. Though I don&rsquo;t know everyone&rsquo;s name, to name a few &ndash; Usha sister, Jolly sister, Monica sister, Aleyamma sister, Josephine sister, Sneha sister, Clotilda sister, Ankita sister, Bhakti sister, Maria sister, Seema sister , Vaishali sister&hellip;&hellip;</p>
      <p>All sweepers have been very helpful and co-operative too. Meghji bhai, Uday bhai, Narayan bhau have been very caring. And I have to mention this &ndash; &lsquo;Meghji bhai&rsquo; is simply outstanding. Extremely dedicated to his work and service to patients, he is more like a &lsquo;medical social worker&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>And from what I overheard from my parents all liftmen and securitymen were extremely kind and helpful.</p>
      <p>Thanking you.</p>
