  <tr>
    <td><p>&bull;<strong>Hip Arthroscopy</strong></p>
      <p>Some common conditions that can be treated with hip arthroscopy are:</p>
      <p>Arthritis. An arthritic hip joint can be cleaned using the arthroscope. Cleaning the joint offers pain relief in a bulk of patients and allows the surgeon to assess the joint, with a view to plan for a definitive surgery for the future.</p>
      <p>Loose bodies. Loose bodies are small fragments of bone or cartilage that come adrift inside the joint, sometimes causing painful spasms and locking of hip movement. They can often be removed via the arthroscope.</p>
      <p>Ligament and cartilage (labrum) tears. The hip contains a large ligament, a structure called &ldquo;ligamentum teres&rdquo;. Diagnosis of any pathology associated with this structure is extremely difficult without hip arthroscopy. Hip arthroscopy also allows us to visualise the cartilage of the hip joint called &ldquo;labrum&rdquo; which can easily be damaged during sport, or as a result of arthritis.</p>
      <p>Synovitis. The lining membrane of the hip joint (synovium) can become inflamed and may occasionally need to be removed. This is easily performed arthroscopically.</p>
      <p>Infection. The hip can become infected, just like many other joints of the body. Causes might include staphylococcus aureus, tuberculosis, and other organisms. Hip arthroscopy is an excellent way of establishing the true nature of the infecting organism so that appropriate antibiotic treatment can be commenced, as well as cleaning out the infection itself.</p>
      <p>Fractures. Major injuries can sometimes cause the pelvis to fracture. This can result in small bone particles breaking loose within the hip joint, leading to loose bodies. These are best retrieved, hip arthroscopy being an excellent method of doing so.</p>
      <p>Tumours. Very rarely it is possible for tumours to grow inside a hip joint. They can be identified and often removed using the arthroscope.<br />
      </p>
      <p>&bull;<strong>Total Hip Replacement</strong></p>
      <p>Surgery</p>
      <p>Surgery essentially involves exposure of the diseased ball and socket joint and replacing both joint surfaces with man-made, artificial components called prostheses.</p>
      <p>There are two types of fixation of components to the parent bone, (a) cemented fixation or (b) uncemented fixation. An uncemented fixation allows bone to grow into it. In the recent years, uncemented components have shown very impressive results and, as a result, I prefer to do uncemneted hip replacements, no matter what the age is, unless local conditions dictate otherwise.</p>
      <p>Following insertion of the components the wound is closed usually with absorbable sutures inside and a drain is inserted. Skin usually gets removable sutures. <br />
      </p>
      <p>&bull;<strong>Resurfacing Arthroplasty</strong></p>
      <p>Surgery essentially involves exposure of the diseased ball and socket joint and replacing both joint surfaces with man-made, artificial metal-on-metal bearing surfaces.</p>
      <p>Contrary to the belief, the scar is usually much bigger, than a total hip replacement scar, after a resurfacing arthroplasty. In the recent years, uncemented components have shown very impressive results and, as a result, I prefer to do uncemented resurfacing for both ball and socket components.</p>
      <p>Following insertion of the components the wound is closed usually with absorbable sutures inside and a drain is inserted. Skin usually gets removable sutures. </p>
