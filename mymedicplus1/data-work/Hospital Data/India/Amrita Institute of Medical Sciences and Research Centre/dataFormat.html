    <td><p><strong>PETER ERIKSSON         US</strong><br />
        During my hospital visit, I was impressed with AIMS for a number of reasons. First of all I encountered pleasant and helpful staff every step of the way. You can really feel the heart of this hospital in the people who work here. Secondly, I was impressed with the competency of the doctors (by the way, nearly everyone speaks excellent english!) as well as the quality and newness of equipment and facilities. Thirdly I was impressed with how fast things happened-- in a matter of days rather than weeks. And last but not least, I was amazed at the cost-- the price of each procedure is a tiny fraction of what it would cost in the west. You can take a first-class tour of India, staying at 5-star hotels that are the equivalent of any in the US, have your medical procedure, and still save many thousands of dollars. AIMS has my whole-hearted recommendation. <br />

        <br />
        There is something special about AIMS. Maybe it is because it was founded by Amma. Amma is the most selfless person I know-- her whole life is dedicated to serving the poor and uplifting humanity. This hospital is an example of that. Although the standard of living is improving very quickly now in India, there are still many people who are very poor and unable to afford the treatment they need. AIMS has helped thousands of poor patients with free treatment, giving them a lifeline they would otherwise not have. Along the way, AIMS has grown into an impressive hospital complex with all the latest equipment, as well as a full-fledged teaching college campus. Although AIMS continues to expand and develop its already impressive range of services and procedures, it still has the essence of compassion and personal care because of Amma, the guiding light of AIMS. <br />

        <strong>JOSH FREEMAN          US </strong><br />
        <br />
        When I compare my experience here at AIMS with recent hospital visits in the US, I actually felt that the staff here at AIMS was more concerned with my well being. Because of the comprehensive details given to me regarding my dental surgury options (details that were not given to me during my consultations in the US), I was able to make a more informed and empowered decision. The service was excellent, I really felt like I was being taken care of. The facilities and staff were top notch! I felt the medical care was actually much better than the care that I received in the US in fact. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>EILEEN JOICE          US </strong><br />
      </p>
      <p>After I was diagnosed with Hepatitis-C, a life threatening disease that can cause liver failure, my doctor in the Boston area of the U.S. recommended a new combo-drug therapy. Since, at the time, I had already scheduled a flight to India I decided to come to AIMS, where I consulted with Dr. Prem, a very knowledgeable gastroenterologist who is an expert in liver diseases. I learned that Dr. Prem had a very successful practice in Los Angeles for many years before returning to his homeland and assuming his current duties at AIMS. I was prescribed the same new combo-drug therapy by Dr. Prem, and underwent treatment at AIMS that included weekly injections and daily oral medications over a period of six months.<br />
          <br />
        After the first month of my treatment, my test results indicated I was responding well to the medication. My liver test results were starting to become normal. The virus seemed to be going away! At the end of my treatment, I tested negative for the Hepatitis C virus. I was overjoyed! With a heart brimming with gratitude, I thanked all those who had been involved in my treatment&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;the doctors, nurses, administration and pharmacy staff . All of them had gone out of their way to help me and support me during the course of my treatment. It has been two-and-a-half years since I finished my treatment at AIMS, and my liver tests are still normal, indicating that I have been cured incredibly of this disease! It is a miracle. Thank You, Amma, thank You! <br />
