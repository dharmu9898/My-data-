It is used as the best therapeutic agent in Naturopathy treatment. Mud retains moisture for a long time. When applied over the body part it causes cooling by absorbing the heat of the body. It reduces the inflammation of the area and improves the circulation, absorption and elimination. When it is applied on the affected part it soothens the inflammation and painful part. It is supposed to be a great purifier as it tries to draw away the toxins from the system by increasing circulation in the affected part where it is applied.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>MASSAGE THERAPY</strong> - Massage provides relief to people of all ages-from infants to seniors and addresses a variety of health conditions, the most prevalent being stress-related tension, which, experts believe, accounts for 80%-90% of disease.
