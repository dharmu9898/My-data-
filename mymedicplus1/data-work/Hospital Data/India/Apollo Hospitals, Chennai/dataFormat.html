    <td><p>It is often said that nothing happens, unless there is a dream first. At the genesis of the Apollo story there was a dream. A dream so powerful, that it helped transform the medical landscape in India.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The dream nurtured and grew within Dr. Prathap C Reddy, the founder Chairman of Apollo Hospitals, until the point of inflection happened in 1983 . A young man succumbing to an ailing heart was what it took to ignite Dr. Reddy's vision into a reality - a vision where quality healthcare was given, where the pursuit of clinical excellence was daily endeavor, India a hub in the medical tourism map and where the Apollo family touches and enriches lives every minute, every day.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Apollo Hospitals started as a 150 bed hospital in Chennai in 1983. And it has to be said, amidst much scepticism. India in the early 80's was not the easiest place for private enterprise. Moreover private healthcare institutions were unknown and they were not doing cutting edge work. 25 years later it is an amazing story of success, achievement and most importantly, dreams realized.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As Apollo Hospitals has made colossal strides to reach where it is, more and more facets of the founding vision have turned to reality. Today Apollo Hospitals is not just one of the country's premier healthcare providers but has also played a pioneering role in helping India become a center-of-excellence in global healthcare.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Apollo Hospitals group today includes over 7500 beds across 43 hospitals in India and overseas, neighbourhood diagnostic clinics, an extensive chain of Apollo Pharmacies, medical BPO and health insurance services and clinical research divisions that are working on the cutting edge of medical science.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However the largest achievement of the Apollo Group has been to take quality healthcare to across the length and breadth of India. Of touching 10 million lives and giving hope to an entire segment of the Indian population who did not have an option beyond limited medical infrastructure.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Apollo has succeeded in being more than just a quality healthcare provider. It has been a major player in scripting the medical landscape of the nation. This is primarily because the group has continuously been at the helm of several game-changing innovations in Indian healthcare.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>By the start of the new millennium, Apollo Hospitals Group had become an integrated healthcare organization with owned and managed hospitals, diagnostic clinics, dispensing pharmacies and consultancy services. In addition, the group's service offerings include healthcare at the patient's doorstep, clinical &amp; diagnostic services, medical business process outsourcing, third party administration services and heath insurance. To enhance performance and service to customers, the company also makes available the services to support the business of healthcare; telemedicine services, education and training programmes &amp; research services and a host of not- for- profit projects.</p>
      <p>Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, India</p>
      <p>The flagship hospital of the Apollo Group, Apollo Hospitals Chennai, was established in 1983. Today it is one of the most respected hospitals in the world, and is also amongst the most preferred destinations for both patients from several parts of India, as well as for medical tourism and medical value travel. The hospital specializes in cutting-edge medical procedures. It has over 60 departments spearheaded by internationally trained doctors who are skillfully supported by dedicated patient-care personnel.<br />
