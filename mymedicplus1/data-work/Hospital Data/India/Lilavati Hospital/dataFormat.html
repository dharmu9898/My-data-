    <td><p>The Lilavati Hospital is the creation of the Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust. Formed in 1978, the Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust has engaged in charitable endeavors across India. Members take personal initiative every year to distribute clothes and medicine to the poor in rural areas and have successfully set up medical clinics in many remote and ill-equipped hamlets of India. The Trust now broadens its sphere of activity by addressing one of the most fundamental rights of every human being: the right to live in good health. In a country where thousands die each day due to their inability to access an expensive health care system the Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Trust seeks to advance the frontiers of specialized medical care and evaluate new techniques designed for a quality health care delivery system.<br />
      The combination of research and education with outpatient and hospital care distinguishes the Lilavati Hospital as a concerned non-profit healthcare organisation. The Hospital maintains a team of doctors, well trained in multi-disciplinary areas of medicine and surgery. Together the men and women of the hospital strive to make each day more comfortable and promising for the patients.<br />
      <br />
      The Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust is helping to spark a new confidence in India&rsquo;s ability to deliver a humane and affordable health care system. The Medical Centre will integrate outpatient and hospital care with research and education under a single roof, which will provide for greater efficiency in meeting the overall needs of a patient.<br />
      The Trust will continuously strive to improve the lives of the present and future generations through responsible application of medical technology in an environment of understanding and care.</p>
      <p><strong>President Speech</strong><br />
          <br />
        It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre.<br />
        This hospital was born out of the fulfillment of my mother's wish to give back to society something of enduring value.<br />
        While building this institution we have been guided by one primary consideration; that there should be no compromise in the quality of care that we deliver, and today our hospital ranks amongst the best in India having the latest of equipment and the best of doctors.<br />

        My dear Shri Narendra Trivediji,<br />
        This is to put on record my sincere appreciation for the very efficient care rendered to me by your staff and doctors during my recent illness at the Lilavati Hospital.<br />
        You have a very dedicated and qualified team of nurses and doctors working in great unison. This has enabled exceptional care for patients and given them a huge level of comfort.<br />
        I would like to compliment the management and the organization at Lilavati for creating a wonderful atmosphere of medical proficiency and hope that you will continue to do the good work that you have set yourselves for the betterment of humanity.<br />
        Please convey my very personal thanks to the concerned people, specially in the operation theatre, the ICU and the staff managing the floor I was on. I would also like you to convey my sincere regards to the security that must have gone through a trying time during this period.<br />
        Warm regards once again and thank you for all the help and care.<br />

      <li><strong>Shri Balasaheb Thackeray</strong><br />
        I visited Lilavati Hospital today. I was stunned to see such a unique landmark in the capital of Maharashtra i.e. Mumbai! It is really fantastic; large corridors, spacious rooms and on top of, large hearted people. I found them working like busy-bees. I was equally surprised when you enter any hospital in town or in any city, it smells of a very typical hospital odor, but in Lilavati Hospital, I smelled lovely aroma which makes you visit the hospital not as a patient but to watch the architectural concept. The structure does not look like a hospital but it looks like a palace! That is the beauty of it.<br />
