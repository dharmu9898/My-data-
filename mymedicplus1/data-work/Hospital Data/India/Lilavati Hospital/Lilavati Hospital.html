The Trust now broadens its sphere of activity by addressing one of the most fundamental rights of every human being: the right to live in good health. In a country where thousands die each day due to their inability to access an expensive health care system the Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Trust seeks to advance the frontiers of specialized medical care and evaluate new techniques designed for a quality health care delivery system.</p>

        My dear Shri Narendra Trivediji,<br />
        This is to put on record my sincere appreciation for the very efficient care rendered to me by your staff and doctors during my recent illness at the Lilavati Hospital.<br />
        You have a very dedicated and qualified team of nurses and doctors working in great unison. This has enabled exceptional care for patients and given them a huge level of comfort.<br />
        I would like to compliment the management and the organization at Lilavati for creating a wonderful atmosphere of medical proficiency and hope that you will continue to do the good work that you have set yourselves for the betterment of humanity.<br />
        Please convey my very personal thanks to the concerned people, specially in the operation theatre, the ICU and the staff managing the floor I was on. I would also like you to convey my sincere regards to the security that must have gone through a trying time during this period.<br />
        Warm regards once again and thank you for all the help and care.<br />

        I visited Lilavati Hospital today. I was stunned to see such a unique landmark in the capital of Maharashtra i.e. Mumbai! It is really fantastic; large corridors, spacious rooms and on top of, large hearted people. I found them working like busy-bees. I was equally surprised when you enter any hospital in town or in any city, it smells of a very typical hospital odor, but in Lilavati Hospital, I smelled lovely aroma which makes you visit the hospital not as a patient but to watch the architectural concept. The structure does not look like a hospital but it looks like a palace! That is the beauty of it.<br />

        Lilavati Hospital is a temple of health care in the finest traditions of world class standards. In a short while it will be the centre of medi-care in India and abroad. My compliments to the Family Trust for this most noble endeavor.<br />

        It was a pleasure and an educative experience for us to visit the Lilavati Hospital.<br />
        I am sure, Lilavati Hospital can benchmark internationally with the best Hospitals in the world, which is something that as an Indian, one feels proud of.<br />
        The enthusiasm and dedication of the doctors and staff is palpable &ndash; that, I believe, will really make the difference. Congratulations to Vijaybhai for a commendable achievement.<br />
