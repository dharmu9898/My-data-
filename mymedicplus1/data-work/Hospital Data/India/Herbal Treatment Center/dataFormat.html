    <td><p><strong>What is Alopecia ?</strong><br />
      Alopecia is a medical terminology for different types of hairloss.</p>
      <p><br />
        <strong>What is alopecia areata?</strong><br />
        </p>
      <p>As per national alopecia areata foundation, alopecia areata (al-oh-PEE-shah air-ee-AH-tah) is a highly unpredictable, autoimmune skin disease resulting in the loss of hair on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. This common but very challenging and capricious disease affects approximately 1.7 percent of the population. Due to the fact that much of the public is still not familiar with alopecia areata, the disease can have a profound impact on one's life and functional status, both at work and at school.</p>
      <p>In alopecia areata, the affected hair follicles are mistakenly attacked by a person's own immune system (white blood cells), resulting in the arrest of the hair growth stage. Alopecia areata usually starts with one or more small, round, smooth bald patche on the scalp and can progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis) or complete body hair loss (alopecia universalis).</p>
      <p>Please refer more about alopecia by visiting www.naaf.org<br />
        What is alopecia as per ayurveda?<br />
      </p>

      <p>The entire process from ordering, to communicating with you, has truly been a pleasure. I am definitely excited to begin treatment.</p>
      <p> I thank you again,</p>

      <p>I suffered from alopecia about 10 months ago.  It was a very traumatic time as it seem there was no cure.  The doctor thought it was thyroid that caused the hair fall but blood test was negative.  I was prescribed with steroid cream and steroid injection by the dermatologist but had to stop medication when I  developed  folliculitis from the steroid cream. <br />
        During this depressing and frustrating time, I was searching on the internet for answers to my condition.   That was when I spotted  Dr Shah website.  My hope was raised when I saw the testimonial and pictures of the many alopecia patient he treated.  Maybe  his therapy could also work on me. <br />
        I contacted Dr Shah and his reply was very reassuring and concern.  It make me felt like I am in a hand of a   experience doctor  that has seen and cure many hair loss victim like me. <br />
        After 3-4 weeks of the herbal treatment, I was surprised and amazed at the result-my hair was not falling as much and miraculously some hair were growing on  the bald patches. Eventually after a few more applications my hair stopped falling.<br />
        Its been about 7 months since the treatment, my hair has grown thicker and darker and I have recovered all the hair that I have lost.  I will continue with the 2 year treatment as advised by Dr Shah as I have trust and faith in his therapy.<br />
        I sincerely would like to thank  Dr Shah for the &ldquo;miracle cure&rdquo;. </p>

      <p>My name is ketaki shah &amp; i have a 5 year old son vidit suffering from diffuse state of alopecia areata.</p>
      <p>He is been having this disease since he was 6 months old. we tried lot of doctors here in u.s.a but his condition was getting worse everyday. he was reccomended steroids &amp; cortizones at the young age of 1 year. but after we met dr. rohit shah our approach towards his medication changed. the best part about is medication is that he doesnt give oral medication, its all topical therapy. we started his treatment back in january '07 when he barely had hair in his scalp. but today after 1 year of his treatment he has regained 80% of his hair back &amp; we r very positive about the rest 20%.</p>
      <p>We would reccomend dr rohit shah to everybody who is suffering from hair loss disorder</p>
      <p>thank you</p>

      <p>I was loosing my confidence because I lost my hair in frontal part of my scalp.</p>
      <p>I consulted Dr Rohit and he explained me that my problem was due to frequent use of DAMANI on my head. Continuous use of DAMANI could destroy the hair follicles which might convert into scarring alopecia.</p>
      <p>I started Dr Rohit`s  herbal treatments in july 2006 and within 6 months I got very good results.i noticed regrowth of so many new hairs on affected area .i regain my confidence in  dancing. I am thankful to entire team of herbal treatment centre.<br />

        I am very happy to say that under your treatments my most of the scalp portion is recovered with new hairs. It is just half duration of the treatments. As said by you that about 12-18 months would be taken for whole treatment but in my case it is 6 months period and about 90% of recovery has obtained. I am really happy because I am getting new hairs at the age of 58. I am really thankful for that..<br />
