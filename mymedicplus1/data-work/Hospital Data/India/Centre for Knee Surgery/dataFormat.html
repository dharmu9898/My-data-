    <td>Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery (CKHS), at Baroda is probably the only unit in India, which addresses the entire range of knee-related problems and offers patients need-based solutions. It has the complete range of treatment facilities for knee &amp; Hip problems starting from non-operative solutions to the minimally invasive arthroscopic surgical technique extending upto complex procedures like knee and hip replacement surgery and Revision knee &amp; hip replacement surgery.<br />
      Situated at Race Course Circle, a prime location in Baroda, Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery is easy to access. The distance of this hospital is about 2.5 kms from railway station, 3 kms from G.S.R.T.C. bus station and 5 kms from the airport.<br />
      This clinic is perhaps the only one of its kind in the entire country to focus just on the knee and hip joint. The benefits of having such a clinic are plenty. Some of them are :-<br />
      Under a single roof, a comprehensive range of state-of-the-art infrastructure is available for anything and everything to do with knee and hip related problems. The Centre is able to invest in the best and the latest possible electronic instrumentation systems for knee &amp; hip surgery which are available in the world, as it just focuses on these joints . It would otherwise be very difficult, if not impossible, to keep on pumping money for updating every area of orthopaedics.<br />
      <p>The operative environment is not contaminated, as we do not have other multispeciality work. If, in the same operation theatre area, different body parts are opened, then the air will always be laden with germs that may cause infection of the knee or hip joint.</p>
      <p>Infection is the most important cause of compromised result after a successful joint replacement surgery. Our operation theatre thus scores over other multi speciality hospitals due to above reasons.</p>
      <p>At the manpower level, our nursing staff, physiotherapists, and all other concerned people acquire an extremely high level of competence because of repetitive work of the same nature.</p>
      <p>The Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery has established itself as a prime centre for medical tourism in India. We have patients coming from U.K., U.S.A., Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Australia, Newzeland, Panama Canal, Mauritius, Fiji Islands &amp; the Middle East countries. These patients include foreigners and not just Non Resident Indians. <br />

    <td><p><strong>Arthroscopic surgery</strong><br />
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> For repair of damaged cartilage<br />
          </li>
        <li> For removal of loose bits of cartilage and bone<br />
          </li>
        <li>To drain infected or excess synovial fluid<br />
          </li>
        <li>For reconstruction of torn ligaments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> An arthroscopy is a pencil-sized fiberoptic instrument attached to a small camera viewer that is used to look inside the joint. During surgery, special slim instruments are passed to remove bits of bone and cartilage from the joint cavity, drain excess synovial fluid, or repair small tears in the meniscus, a pad of special rubbery cartilage in the knee. The arthroscope is inserted through a very small incision, which leaves little scarring.</p>
      <p> This surgery does not require general anesthesia, and is done under local anaesthesia. It does not involve any blood loss. This is an advanced form of surgery and requires a very high level of costly instrumentation system. There are very few centres in India with a proper set-up offering this service.</p>
      <p> <br />
        <strong>Osteotomy</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p> May be an option when Osteoarthritis involve a single, weight-bearing compartment of the knee joint.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>  To correct deformities by selective trimming away of bone<br />
          </li>
        <li> Improves joint alignment<br />
          </li>
        <li>Generally preferred for young, active patients</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p> Osteotomy literally means &ldquo;bone cutting&rdquo;. Even slight bone deformities can put pressure and strain on joints, and contribute to Osteoarthritis. The deformity is corrected by removing or adding triangular wedges of bone. Osteotomy can be useful in preventing deterioration of joints with Osteoarthritis due to a preexisting deformity such as bow legged ness. Osteotomy is generally preferred for young, active patients.</p>
      <p> <br />
        <strong>Primary Total Knee Replacement (as discussed in Total knee replacement)</strong><br />
        <br />
        <strong>Uni Condylar knee Replacement</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p> This is a form of surgery which is useful in a particular category of patients where a small part of the knee joint is affected by wear and tear and the rest of the joint is well preserved. When applicable, this surgical procedure can be offered to the patient with the advantage of much reduced cost and relatively quick functional recovery. Only a small part of the knee surface is replaced in this procedure.</p>
      <p> <strong><br />
        Revision Total Knee Replacement</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p> Although less commonly required, sometimes, the knee which has already been replaced earlier might need another procedure. This is called Revision Total Knee Replacement. It requires much more precision of surgical technique, a high level of instrumentation system and experience in this particular form of surgery.</p>
      <p> Centre for Knee Surgery does all the above category of surgical procedures on a regular basis and the total number of patients treated with surgical procedures related to the knee would exceed seven thousand. This has built up a very high experience and expertise level for the team members starting from nursing staff, operation theatre assistants, surgeons, physiotherapists and others.<br />

        <strong>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rabuka during post operative</strong><br />
      rehabilitaion with Dr. Mody<br />
      I first heard about the Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery from friends in Fiji, particularly Thakorbhai Patel of Toorak, Suva, whose wife had bilateral knee replacement in 2005. Himmat Lodhia of Lords Jewelers introduced me to these former patients and I am forever grateful to him and the former patients of the Centre.<br />
      <br />
      What my wife and I experienced from the time we landed at the airport, and for the whole period of our stay in the centre, far exceeded all we had been told in Fiji.<br />
      The medical staff and the ward staff were extremely professional and friendly. The ward is very well laid-out and the reception area very neat, professionally arranged with a homely atmosphere - thanks to Mrs. Harshida Mody's influence.<br />
      <br />
      Dr. Bharat S. Mody is truly a professional man who is a credit to his field of specialty. It has been a real pleasure and honor to have trusted my life with him and his staff.<br />
      <br />
      I wish you all God's blessings. <br />

      I have been suffering with knee problems (both knees) for such a long time that I had given up hopes of any improvement in this lifetime. One year before I had surgery I had gone to an Ayurvedic center for treatment. This only gave me a temporary relief from painful legs.</p>
      <p>In Baroda I went to see Dr. Bharat Mody for consultation. His examination and explanation was very thorough and detailed. He diagnosed the problem with confidence and recommended surgery on both legs at the same time (few days apart). I was very hesitant to go through the surgery out of fear and people were giving ' mixed messages'. Dr. Mody gave me confidence and assured 100% recovery and improvement after surgery. I agreed to get both knees done.</p>
      <p>Before, during and after the surgery I received the best treatment you could expect from him as well as his well trained staff. This goes for all his patients without saying. Anyone who has knee problems will not regret to see Dr. Mody first.</p>
      <p>Today I am 'kicking and running', thanks to Dr. Bharat Mody. Two months after the surgery I took a five country trip for three weeks to South America. It was a painless experience and the best trip I ever had having gone on similar trips to China, Africa, Middle East, Far East, Europe, Nepal as well as places within United States.</p>

        I was operated for both my total knee replacments at Dr Bharat S. Mody's CENTRE FOR KNEE &amp; HIP SURGERY in December, 2003.</p>
      <p>I have had the best treatment both pre and post operative at this modern Centre. Dr. Bharat Mody and his better half, Dr Harshida Mody together with their entire team of very professionally and efficiently trained nursing and administrative staff had looked after me so well that I never felt homesick. I even had chance of celebrating my birthday with all at the Centre, including all patients and staff, who enjoyed such an occasion for the first time.</p>
      <p>How can I forget in my life such an excellent centre with best doctors and staff? I would always recommend Dr. Bharat Mody's Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery to all those who suffer knee ailments.</p>

        Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery is definitely a medical boon for people having mobility problems. The service provided by the Centre is extremely commendable as Dr. Mody and his team has all necessary expertise for not only local but also NRI patients.</p>
      <p>I brought my father for a Total Knee Replacement from Fiji, and despite the Indo-Fijians having their ancestral bond in India, we had no relatives here, which gave us second thoughts as to how we will adjust to the new environment due to this being our first visit to India. However, despite this, prior to our arrival, all arrangements were made very professionally and our stay at the Centre was really memorable as the entire team was always at our service making us feel comfortable. We were referred to the Centre from another patient (in Fiji), who has a successful knee replacement done here. In addition to this, the Centre's website also provided further know-how&rsquo;s and patient referrals as well.</p>
      <p>My father's mobility was almost none at the time we arrived at the Centre, however after the surgery he can walk perfectly well. Despite my father having pre-medical condition i.e. diabetes and high BP, the operation was carried out without any complications.</p>
      <p>In Fiji, my father's operation was impossible as he had severe breathing problems and since both knees are replaced at once, and considering the duration of the operation, there was high possibility of losing him through General anesthesia. Dr. Mody's medical approach was quite accommodating of this as patients are given spinal anesthesia while both knees are replaced in a lapse of 4 days, giving patients time to respond to the replacement done.</p>
      <p>With due respect to the above I have no hesitation in recommending the services of the Centre to people with knee problems in Fiji.</p>
      <p>On behalf of my family, I wish Dr. Mody and his team all success in future endeavors. May god bless him for his wonderful expertise<br />

        Dear Dr Bharat Mody</p>
      <p>After a brief stay in Mumbai we arrived home safely in Nairobi. It was my intention to write to you immediately but due to unavoidable circumstances I was unable to deal with correspondence and I sincerely apologize for the delay.</p>
      <p>I trust you are all well at Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery. I take this opportunity to thank you both, together with your team of young and talented doctors for a very successful operation. As a result, the quality of my life has changed tremendously. Presently I am able to walk with an upright posture with the help of the tripod stick. Hopefully, in the near future, I will walk without it.</p>
      <p>Since our arrival in Nairobi, we have received lots of visitors and they were simply amazed to see me walking and cannot believe how well I recovered and in such a short period of time as most of them were aware of my condition prior to leaving for Vadodara. They have concluded that this is a miracle. Yes, I endorse this statement; as we all know that God works in mysterious ways. Out of the blues, we received some encouraging information through the Internet about The Centre for Knee &amp; Hip Surgery. Having read your informative material thoroughly, it was so impressive and moreover answered all my questions and doubts. Ultimately I was able to make an immediate decision. To date we have no regrets at all to have come to Vadodara; on the contrary we have pleasant memories of our stay there.</p>
      <p>From the day we arrived at your Clinic we were received with such warmth and hospitality by you and your team of doctors, your charming wife Dr Harshida, and your petit nursing staff who made me feels so much at home. You, Dr Mody, and your assistant doctors, worked so hard and with such dedication to ensure the success of my knee surgery prior to the operation and the after care. A special word of thanks to Dr Shrish Mishra, whose words of encouragement and caring attitude made me feel so confident and assisted with quick recovery.</p>
      <p>Your physiotherapist Dr Achal Patel was excellent, at all times and who also assisted with my quick recovery. The result is obvious. My surgery was so successful that I am walking upright without any pain and most of all I feel great about myself. Keep up the wonderful work and how proud we are to observe the service you offer to all who need your expertise. Your nursing staff needs to be commended to the highest level. They were charming, hard working and served us with a smile at all times and so were the boys in blue who performed their duties so well.</p>
      <p>Congratulations to you Dr Mody and your wonderful and hardworking work force for the service you render to those who need you. We have recommended you to so many who have seen me and asked for your contact.</p>
      <p>May God bless you all!<br />

        Dear Bharat Mody Sir,</p>
      <p>This phase is very true for all of us. Getting my mother ready for such a major surgery was indeed an &lsquo;Herculean&rsquo; task for all of us but the day she interacted with you, almost half of her worries vanished. I was so much worried about her pre-op and post-op care before coming to your hospital, but the way you &lsquo;yourself&rsquo;, your staff and all the young Doctors, working in the hospital took care of my mother, my worries turned into a pleasant surprise. The care provided by your hospital staff was so excellent that it has set a standard for me, which I wish to incorporate amongst my hospital and sisters. Your hospital management is indeed an inspirational one for me. The patient and the relatives are treated in such a way that they almost forget they are in a hospital. Infact my father, kept on referring your hospital as &lsquo;Hotel&rsquo; which was indeed the comfort level provided by everybody to all of us.<br />
        The greatest comfort was provided by yourself to my mother. You made my mother absolutely relax during her stay. No words can express my gratitude for you in providing such an excellent care and atmosphere. You are a Great Brand Ambassador of Doctors to the patients through out the world.<br />
        Thank you very much.</p>

        Dear Bharatbhai,</p>
      <p>The knee operation has given me a new life. Before the knee surgery I was not able to walk half a block and I was taking a lot of pain medicine. After the operation all the pain is gone. Now I walk for half an hour (about 2 miles) everyday. I do my bicycles for 30 minutes daily. I also am able to do my yoga exercises. I am really feeling great. I also swim on regular basis. My son Niraj says that dad you are going to live 100 years. I do not need any pain medication now.</p>
      <p>Sorry doctor I was not able to see you when you were in Houston.</p>

      <p>I had been suffering great pains in both of my knees for more than 10 years.  My mobility was very limited, and even when I needed to move I had to wrap crepe bandages and take the pain killers. My son had been insisting on me to have treatment but I was very reluctant thinking the surgery may complicate the matter and make my situation worse.</p>
      <p>Your centre was recommended to me by my very close friend who had his wife&rsquo;s operation at your centre, but I was still very skeptical to have a surgery.  My son, Mustafa, managed to visit your website and found more information including testimonials from other patients who underwent surgery at your centre. After reading the materials and from the pressure from my wife and children, I decided to give in and asked Mustafa to communicate to your centre for further arrangements.</p>
      <p> Dr. Harshida was very prompt to respond to our questions and provided details and guidance on how we could plan our trip and also assured us that we would be taken care as soon as we arrive at Vadodara.  This is a very positive point for your centre</p>
      <p>On arrival, we were received very well by your staff and felt that we were in good hands.   We were very much impressed with your Centre and the professional manner in which you diagnosed me and advised what I would expect to go through.  This increased my confidence and made much easier to adjust myself psychologically, ready for the surgery.</p>
      <p>Both pre and post surgery care was excellent and I must thank Dr. Harshida and staffs for the kind words of encouragement which I believe aided a lot towards my steady recovery, nor can I miss to thank you, Dr. Mody, for your personal attention you had given to my case despite your busy schedule.   I performed the exercises given religiously every day. I can now walk without any supports and my confidence has grown.</p>
      <p>All I want to say is that this surgery has changed my outlook to life; I have become a different person all together.  The development in the science and technology and especially Dr. Mody&rsquo;s special techniques has made this possible that I can do things which I thought I would never ever be able to do for the rest of my life!</p>
      <p>Dr. Mody, I must thank you and your team for all the support and assistance you provided to us all the way.  I will readily recommend your centre 100% for anyone who has to undergo joint replacement.</p>
