    <td><strong>Dr. Mekhala Devi Natavar</strong>
      <p>Professor, Duke University, Durham, N.C., USAThis institute was highly recommended by my friends who had also been treated and found relief from their illnesses. I have been in pain for the past few year due to a car accident. I have been suffering from a ripped rotatar cuff, bursitus of the biceps, tendinitus and neck pain. For this I had been receiving massages &amp; physical therapy for 10 months in the USA, with no results. I had heard of Kerala Ayurveda Kendra and decided to fly to India to get treatment. Though I only received treatment for 10 days, I experienced a 75% improvement in my condition. I will definitely come back &amp; I recommend others to come too.</p>
