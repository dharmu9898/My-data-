      <p>Chronic diseases generally cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by allopathic medication, nor do they just disappear. Chronic diseases tend to become more common with age. Eighty-eight percent of Americans over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health condition. Chronic diseases contribute much to illness, disability, morbidity and mortality.</p>
      <p>Chronic diseases can be cured through combined approach of various systems of alternative and complementary medicines. This stimulates healing on the physical, emotional and spiritual levels to restore vitality and creative engagement in life.</p>
