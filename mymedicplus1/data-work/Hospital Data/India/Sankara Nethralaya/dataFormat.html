    <td><p>It was in 1976 when addressing a group of doctors, His Holiness Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, the Sankaracharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam spoke of the need to create a hospital with a missionary spirit.</p>
      <p>His words marked the beginning of a long journey to do God's own work.</p>
      <p>On the command of His Holiness, Dr. Sengamedu Srinivasa Badrinath, along with a group of philanthropists founded a charitable not-for-profit eye hospital...</p>
      <p>One that would bring world-class eye care to the people of India. One that would adopt a single standard of care for all, rich or poor. One that would share the fruits of its knowledge and spread its concept of care to distant parts of this country.<br />
          <br />
      </p>
      <p>In a solemn function held at the premises of the Vijaya Hospital with Semmangudi Srinivasa Aiyer offering the prayer, Mrs (Dr) T Agarwal inaugurated the project.</p>
      <p>On the auspicious day of Vinayaka Chaturthi, the sixth day of September in the year 1978, the hospital came into existence.</p>
      <p>It was named Sankara Nethralaya, which means &quot;The Temple of the Eye&quot;. The long journey for vision with a mission began.</p>
      <p>In 28 years, the hospital has gained international excellence and is acclaimed for its quality care and compassion. Sankara Nethralaya today has grown into a super specialty institution for ophthalmic care and receives patients from all over the country and from abroad. Sankara Nethralaya family today has over 1000 individuals with one vision &ndash; to propagate the Nethralaya philosophy; the place of our work is an Alaya and Work will be our worship, which we shall do with sincerity, dedication and utmost love with a missionary spirit.</p>
      <p>Sankara Nethralaya has been described by Shri Nani A. Palkivala, an eminent legal expert and former Indian Ambassador to USA, as the &quot;Best Managed Charitable Organization in India&quot;. Sir Ratan Tata Trust has observed Sankara Nethralaya as a High Performing Knowledge Institution &ndash; mission driven, a proven track record, acknowledged nationally and internationally for its expertise and excellence in Ophthlmic care with almost all eye sub-specialities, good management systems, a vibrant set of human resources and a participative system of decision-making.</p>
      <p>On an average, 1200 patients walk through our doors and 100 surgeries are performed every day. In our journey for excellence, we have received many awards and appreciation of our efforts. And we still have a long way to go&hellip;&hellip; <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>QUALITY POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>Pledge to meet the patients&rsquo; requirements by offering expert ophthalmic care with love and compassion through a committed professional team.</p>
      <p>We commit to achieve continual Quality improvement to our Services through the Quality Management System while complying with all applicable regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p><strong>QUALITY OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> To maintain the quality of ophthalmic services in accordance with international standards.<br />
          </li>
        <li> Effective utilization of infrastructure facilities including manpower.<br />
          </li>
        <li> To ensure continued patients&rsquo; satisfaction.<br />
          </li>
        <li> Ongoing care and concern for maintaining high level of staff satisfaction and motivation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Quality Initiatives</strong></p>
      <p>Patients safety and well-being shall always be our top priority. We shall strive for continuous quality improvement and complying with the international standards to implement quality systems. We shall strive for maintaining high level of staff satisfaction and motivation always.</p>
      <p>Quality has been the by word in our service. All patients receive the same care at our Hospitals. Trained professionals who have the physical infrastructure readily available to them render state-of-the art care.</p>
      <p>To ensure quality, we earnestly follow systems and procedures and are the first ISO 9002 certified Eye Hospital in Asia. We have introduced TQM policies and have been recently audited by BVQI who have recommended re-certification to us.</p>
      <p>In the Jagdguru Sri Kanchi Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi Nethra Nilayam, through the Jaslok Community Ophthalmology Centre almost 10,000 cataract surgeries are performed totally free of cost amounting to 50% of all cataract surgeries done in the complex. The addition of the new complex has made it possible to now offer 'walk in' services for cataract surgeries.</p>
      <p>We have trained more than 300 Ophthalmologists all over the country.</p>
      <p>Thanks to innovative information technology devices, expertise of Sankara Nethralaya would be available to all service providers. Through innovative telemedicine approaches, basic facilities would be made available all over Tamil Nadu. We shall continue to practice &quot;non-commercial&quot; medicine. We shall preach 'institutional practice' - as it results in scientific practice and inculcates 'team work' culture. We believe that collective functioning yields better results. We shall offer education that sharpens the analytical mind, builds character and cultivates responsibility in each individual for his or her work.<br />
      </p>
      <p>The concepts of Nethralaya are unique. Describing it as a &ldquo;privatized public sector&quot; would be apt. But perhaps the best description of Sankara Nethralaya would be the &quot;physical perception of a divine will&quot;. </p>
