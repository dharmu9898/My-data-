    <td><p>It was in 1976 when addressing a group of doctors, His Holiness Sri Jayendra Saraswathi, the Sankaracharya of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam spoke of the need to create a hospital with a missionary spirit.On the command of His Holiness, Dr. Sengamedu Srinivasa Badrinath, along with a group of philanthropists founded a charitable not-for-profit eye hospital.One that would bring world-class eye care to the people of India. One that would adopt a single standard of care for all, rich or poor. One that would share the fruits of its knowledge and spread its concept of care to distant parts of this country.<br />
 </p>
      <p> In a solemn function held at the premises of the Vijaya Hospital with Semmangudi Srinivasa Aiyer offering the prayer, Mrs (Dr) T Agarwal inaugurated the project.On the auspicious day of Vinayaka Chaturthi, the sixth day of September in the year 1978, the hospital came into existence.It was named <strong>Sankara Nethralaya</strong>, which means &quot;The Temple of the Eye&quot;. The long journey for vision with a mission began.</p>
      <p>In 28 years, the hospital has gained international excellence and is acclaimed for its quality care and compassion. <strong>Sankara Nethralaya</strong> today has grown into a super specialty institution for ophthalmic care and receives patients from all over the country and from abroad. Sankara Nethralaya family today has over 1000 individuals with one vision &ndash; to propagate the Nethralaya philosophy; the place of our work is an Alaya and Work will be our worship, which we shall do with sincerity, dedication and utmost love with a missionary spirit.</p>
      <p><strong>Sankara Nethralaya</strong> has been described by Shri Nani A. Palkivala, an eminent legal expert and former Indian Ambassador to USA, as the &quot;Best Managed Charitable Organization in India&quot;. Sir Ratan Tata Trust has observed Sankara Nethralaya as a High Performing Knowledge Institution &ndash; mission driven, a proven track record, acknowledged nationally and internationally for its expertise and excellence in Ophthlmic care with almost all eye sub-specialities, good management systems, a vibrant set of human resources and a participative system of decision-making.</p>
