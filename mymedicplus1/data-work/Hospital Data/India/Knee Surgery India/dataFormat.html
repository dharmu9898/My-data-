      <p>This is Ashish from Abu Dhabi. My mom is doing great. I take her out for long walks every day. She is able to kneel and offer Namaz. Her pains have disappeared. I wish to place my sincere thanks for the excellent service provided to my mom. Ashish, Abu Dhabi <br />

        Bilateral painless high flex knee replacements</p>
      <p>We would like to thank the MD and all his staff, especially Dr.Venkatachalam for the two successful Knee Replacements. Our stay here has been truly wonderful, people have been outstanding and we can't thank you all enough, we will miss you all, but remember you all. Kindest regards and love.

        Bilateral High flex knee replacements</p>
      <p>I write to you to express my sincere gratitude for taking good care of my mom over the past weeks. My mom is feeling great after the total knee replacement surgery. She is fully functional now and is able to fold her legs, walk with out any pain and more than anything else sleep well during night with no pain. I want to let you know that your kind nature, attention to details and personalized treatment to individual patients and their situation is what sets you apart from the peers. We are extremely pleased with your services and will recommend to our friends. You are a true blessing to the medical field. Keep up your great service and I again thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts<br />

        High flex knee replacement ,Spain</p>
      <p>Many thanks for your message and I have very much pleasure in returning my very best wishes for a very Happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. I am pleased to tell you that I am making good progress and working very hard with the physio. A ll the very best to you and yours from your friend in Spain. Norman Galloway<br />

      <p><strong>Mr.Ken Austin, Bradford UK</strong><br />
        80 year old great grand dad</p>
      <p>Dear Doctor My swim in Greece went very well even though I wasn&rsquo;t able to do my original swim due to rough seas. However, I think I covered about the same distance. You will have seen from Polly&rsquo;s photos that I had 4 swimmers to accompany me though they stayed well behind so that it was my swim. You may be pleased to know that I raised a total of &pound;535 which will go towards building an extension to a school for disabled children in the south of Tamil Nadu. My knee is doing very well although I bruised it today in a fall in the supermarket. I quite frequently fall when the toe of my prosthesis catches on the floor &amp; I have nothing to support me. Otherwise the joint seems to be doing well. I went to my GP last week because I still had some pain &amp; couldn&rsquo;t straighten my knee very well. I thought that this might be because of fluid retention. He said that I had better have an x-ray so I am waiting for the results of that. On the NHS it takes about 10 days normally but we are having postal difficulties at the moment so I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll get a result but actually the joint seems a lot easier now.. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been much interest locally in my experiences. I never cease from extolling your expertise but I suppose there aren&rsquo;t that many people, needing a joint replacement, who can afford to fly to India. I also have nothing but praise for the way I was treated at the hotel. I found the staff to be very helpful in spite of language difficulties . The staff at the hospital was also very kind &amp; did their best to make me comfortable. I am very grateful for the attention I received &amp; am certainly in much better condition than I was when I arrived in Chennai. I will email you again when I get the results of the x-rays.<br />
      </p>
      <p>&quot;For any one contemplating a total knee replacement under the care of Dr. Venkatachalam, I would say you have nothing to worry about. You will find that he is there at every step of the way; from the time of the operation to the day you leave. Such continuity of care is not something you will find in the UK hospitals&quot;.
