    <td><p><strong>Pyramid Treatment</strong></p>
      <p>Pyramids are found in Egypt and till date they remain objects of wonder, mystery and an innate secret. The Great Pyramid, the seventh wonder of the world was to have been built some 5000 years ago and it has withstood the ravages of time.</p>
      <p>These pyramids are not confined to Egypt alone but are found in China, South America, South Africa, The Himalayas, Siberia and Mexico. They stand as models of man's architectural fete.</p>
      <p>We look at pyramids as great healers. A pyramid is a polyclinic. It relieves man from pain of any kind if one sits at the centre of a pyramid for sometime. By keeping a wooden pyramid near the bed, people have reported that they have been relieved of their sufferings and illness. At least their problems are listened to a great extent.</p>
      <p>By sitting inside a wooden or stone pyramid for sometime, one attains mental peace, equilibrium and he is rejuvenated to face his task again with a new vigour and enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>Dr.M.N.Sankar proved that if a patient is given treatment, especially acupuncture and acupressure inside a pyramid, he could be healed of his disease quickly as the pyramid sends rays that accumulate the healing. Two or three visits instead of twenty could completely cure a patient.</p>
      <p>People could do meditation and yoga inside a pyramid with unexpectedly lasting results. The energy field created inside a pyramid makes men healthy and keep things intact from deterioration. For example, even cooked food has not become stale or damaged.</p>
      <p>A study about pyramids is an interesting pursuit; experiencing the benefits satisfies man's quest.<br />

      <p>Acupuncture &ndash; although it is an Indian art of healing, the credit goes to china because they developed ironically and scientifically and reintroduced it to the world. The highly developed knowledge of medicinal systems received the patronage of kings of India. Thereafter the time came when ambassadors went to East Asian Countries, including Ceylon &amp; Indonesia. Amongst them were some of the Buddhist monks who preached &amp; practiced and it was recognised as Acupuncture technique of treatment for curing various diseases.</p>
      <p>Over the last twenty years or so, Acupuncture has made great in roads into western forms of healing &ndash; so much so that even the World Health Organization (W.H.O) concluded that not only is Acupuncture a true form of therapy, but it can also cure more than 300 different types of diseases (WHO Chronicle No.34, 1980).</p>
      <p> Now you may have a doubt, how a plain Acupuncture Needle works, when modern medicinal needles doesn&rsquo;t? Yes, you must understand that our body totally refuse any form of synthetic medicine. But it has the ability to mend its own defect by autonomous healing system.</p>
      <p>In Acupuncture, at the secret point, where the electro-magnetism is very low, is stimulated by very fine needle painlessly. The patient gets the Electro-Magnetic power from the hands of Acupuncturist as well as the cosmic power from the universe which is observed as if like an antenna.</p>
      <p>During this process our body secretes various substances like Endorphin, Serotorin, Acetylcholine, Histamine, 5 H.T., Bradichinning, Epinephrin, Glycin and Gamma &ndash; Amino butyric acid. This was invented by Prof.Abbas Alavi, Chief Scientist of Nuclear Medicine at Bildebia University, U.S.A. He adds, it cost nearly U.S. $3, 00,000 to get 1 gram of Endorphin synthetically at Standford University USA, whereas 2 grams of this valuable substances are secreated naturally through the brain by skillful Acupuncture!</p>
      <p><strong>Why don&rsquo;t you go for it?</strong></p>
      <p>Acupressure is a type of bodywork that involves pressing specific points on the body with the fingers, knuckles, and palms (and sometimes the elbows and feet) to relieve pain, reduce stress, and promote general good health. Developed in India &amp; China some 5,000 years ago, perhaps out of the natural human instinct to hold or rub a place on the body that hurts, acupressure is part of the holistic system of traditional chinese medicine (TCM) that also includes acupuncture. (Interestingly, the use of acupressure predates acupuncture by some 2,500 years.)</p>
      <p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong><br />
        Traditional Chinese medicine views health as the constantly changing flow of vital energy, or qi (pronounced &quot;chee&quot;) throughout the body. If that flow is hindered, sickness may develop. The goal of acupressure (and acupuncture) is to release blocked energy by stimulating specific points--called acupoints--along the body's 14 primary meridians, or energy channels. Pressing firmly and steadily on the proper acupoints, it is suggested, can promote energy flow to a part of the body that is experiencing disease or discomfort, enabling it to heal itself more readily. While acupuncture involves stimulation with needles, acupressure typically uses only the practitioner's hands to restore the balance of qi. <br />

      <p>Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medical practice that encompasses a range of treatments including medicinal herbs, changes in diet, meditation, massage, and yoga to maintain or restore health. The word Ayurveda is Sanskrit, meaning &quot;science (or knowledge) of life.&quot; Perhaps the oldest continually practiced health-care system in the world (the tradition has been handed down from masters to pupils in India for more than 5,000 years), Ayurveda is rooted in the belief that health results from harmony between mind, body, and spirit. Ayurvedic practitioners in India receive state-recognized training on par with that of Western medical specialists</p>
      <p><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>
      <p>According to Ayurveda, every person contains some of the universe's five basic elements: earth, air, fire, water, and ether (or space). The combination of these elements in each individual breaks down into three metabolic body types, or doshas. The doshas are known as vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata consists of ether and air, and is associated with lightness and movement. Pitta is made of fire and is associated with transformative metabolic processes--the digestion of food to produce energy, for example. Kapha consists of earth and water and is associated with structure and stability. Although each type of energy resides in every individual, one is usually dominant.</p>
      <p>The theory behind Ayurveda is that sickness is caused by an imbalance in one or more of the doshas. There are many things that can affect this balance, from dietary choices to the change of seasons. Stress at work or in one's family can throw off the harmony of the doshas as well. The result is the accumulation of toxicity in the body and mind.</p>
      <p>Once the causes of an illness are identified, treatment will be given by our expert Ayurvedic practitioner, to restore balance and to remove toxicity. Proponents say that when energy is balanced, the body's natural defenses strengthen, making it easier to prevent or recover from illness. <br />

      <p>Naturopathy is the system of healing in which diseases are cured by means of all natural and rational remedies such as light, water, air, heat, exercise, diet and other physiological measures. Naturopathy is built upon the dictum of Hippocrates, the father of medicine, who declared &quot;Nature cures; not  the physicians &quot;. Naturopathy is a combination of different methods of natural healing. It is also a way of life. It is known by different names - Nature Cure, the natural methods, the New science of healing and Healing from within. Fasting to relieve the symptoms of an upset stomach, using water as a healing aid or eating a sensible balanced diet to maintain good health are all examples of Naturopathy.</p>
      <p>The origins of the practice can be traced back over two thousand years to the time of Hippocrates. Hippocrates and his colleagues considered disease to be an effect of some imbalance in the elements like air, water and other natural factors such as food.</p>
      <p>An unhealthy lifestyle can cause many diseases. So it is better to avoid a diet high in fat, salt and refined Carbohydrates, smoking , excess consumption of alcohol and high stress levels. Naturopathy advocates a new life style with corrective habits such as exercise, a good diet and a moderate approach towards all things Naturopathic life style should be viewed as a method of disease prevention. In Naturopathy, the fundamental healing force is considered to be nature itself, that is the power of the individual to defeat disease.<br />
        Naturopathy is primarily and fundamentally drugless and blood-less yet in its broader aspects it does admit the use of both natural medicine and surgery when their use is constructive. The techniques employed in nature cure vary with the experience of its practitioner.</p>
      <p>Naturopathy helps to prevent many common diseases such as headaches, the common cold, hypertension, peptic ulcers and many of the disorders associated with ageing, including diabetes. It aims at educating people about adopting the type of lifestyle which is conducive to good health.<br />
