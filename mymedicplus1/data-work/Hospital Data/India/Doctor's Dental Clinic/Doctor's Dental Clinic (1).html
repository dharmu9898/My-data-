    <td><p>This Testimonial is written following dental work carried out by Dr. Mathew Thomas at Doctors Dental Clinic in Trivandrum, Southern India. It was recommended that I see him following a casual conversation with a holiday maker and patient on a previous holiday in India. I am so very very pleased that I followed up this recommendation. He works in a very professional way, is honest, trustworthy and sensible in his approach. He is not critical of previous dentistry but offers advice on treatment needed. He is gentle, he is committed to a very high standard of work. His clinic is very clean, he is very approachable and understood what I wanted. His work is guaranteed and on returning to the UK, my dentist has made very positive comments about the standard of work he carried out. I will be returning to Trivandrum in about 2 years to have some more treatment which is excellent and is, of course, far less expensive than dental costs in the UK. At the same time patients can enjoy a wonderful holiday in Kerala. Dr Matthew and his wife, also a dentist should be congratulated on their work ethic and standard. They are exceptionally friendly and ethical professionals.<br />

        My first time visit to Doctors Dental clinic was for extensive root canal and bridge work. Their treatment was painlessly efficient, top class work that was executed without delay, at a price a fraction of my quotes in Canada. With the fitting of my new bridges I left with a new mouth, and a very high regard for the Indian dental service. Thanks Dr. Thomas and Staff.<br />

      Although I have spent many hours in the dentist chair, I cannot thank you enough for your professional skills and personal care. My treatment was pain free in your clinic, which had high hygiene standards along with excellent dentistry staff. I would have no hesitation in recommending you and your clinic as you surpass European standards. Thank you once again for your care and diligence.</p>

      <p>&quot;Your clinic is world class. My treatment for oral prophylaxis was painless. I would compare the standards you maintain, to most of the sophisticated dental clinics in Great Britain. I highly recommend you to visit Doctor's Dental Clinic.&quot;<br />

      <p>&quot;Hi am from Germany, I visited Doctor's Dental Clinic for the correction of my fractured filling on the lower tooth. The tooth coloured filling done at Doctor's Dental Clinic was excellent, I am extremely thankful to them for restoring my faith in dentists.&quot;<br />

      <p>&quot;I am a non resident Indian from United States. I came here for tooth filling and was surprised to see the high end dental equipments used by Doctors Dental Clinic for treatment. The clinic infrastructure is excellent and better than many clinics in the US. I would recommend Doctor's Dental Clinic to all my friends in US.&quot;<br />

      <p>&quot;With atleast two dentists present all the time to take care of our dental problems individually with two ultra modern dental chairs, practicing four handed dentistry, I didn't have to wait too long. Not to mention the whole set up, state-of-the-art equipments and surrounding makes coming to the clinic a pleasure.&quot;<br />

      <p>&quot;The overall layout of the practice was very impressive and the attention given by the Dentist and Nurses was excellent. You more than came up to expectations. The tooth now feels like a normal tooth.&quot;<br />

      <p>&quot;I would like to let you know about my pleasant experience at Doctor&rsquo;s Dental Clinic. I was able to make an appointment online through this website which helped in saving time. The dentist has consultation on saturday evening hours which was very convenient for me. I required a dental procedure which was taken care of immediately. I am very thankful for your services.&quot;<br />
