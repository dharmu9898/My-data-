        Testimonial: 	In May of 2008, I was kicked in the back of the head at a violin concert. I was in immediate pain, but didn't realize the extent of my injury. 30 hours later, i was in the ER with blurry vision, vomiting, terrible head pain, and loss of concentration. I was sent away with the diagnosis of a &quot;tension headache&quot;.</p>
      <p>Following was months in bed, dozens of doctors visits, with no one able to help me with anything except pain medication. After 8 months, my husband arranged for me to travel to India and been seen by Dr. Walia. After one day of tests, Dr. Walia was able to provide me with an answer to my dizziness as well as my pain.</p>
      <p>I'm still amazed to be here at home, and to have so much of my life restored and I'm still recovering from the surgery. The hospital staff was gracious and kind and always checking to be sure that everything was satisfactory. I know without a doubt that Dr. Walia is the best possible doctor in the world that I could have seen, and my family feels fortunate and incredibly blessed that I got to be treated by him and his team.Thank you so much. We have already referred at least 12 people. Our family will never forget all you have done for us!'</p>
