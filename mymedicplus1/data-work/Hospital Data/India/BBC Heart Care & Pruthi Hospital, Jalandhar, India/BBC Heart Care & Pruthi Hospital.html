    <td><p>BBC Heart Care, has been named after Baba Budha Sahib, the first Head Priest of Harmandir Sahib Ji (Golden Temple), Amritsar. He was a dedicated soul who had the privilege of serving the first six Sikh Gurus. He was a living apostle of piety, humility and selfless service- the ideals which we intend to emulate and put into practice.<br />
    </p>
      <p> The idea of BBC Heart Care was conceived by Dr. C. S. Pruthi MD, a renowned physician &amp; cardiologist of Jalandhar, who resolved to mitigate the sufferings of heart patients by bringing Heart Care based on international standards within the reach of every individual. He worked with missionary zeal and, by the grace of God, attracted a group of dedicated persons who joined hads with him to transform his dream into a reality. The Ultra-modern cardiac care center in Pruthi Hospital, Jalandhar was finally inaugurated by Dr. Manmohan Singh (Presently Prime Minister of India) on 27 th January 1996.</p>

    <td><p><strong>Ajaib Singh,Bypass Surgery</strong></p>
      <p>Ninety-Year-Old Ajaib Singh has received a new lease of life, thanks to surgeous of BBC Heart Care, Pruthi Hospital, Jalandhar, who performed a bypass surgery on his beating heart-reportedly the first operation of its kind in Punjab.</p>
      <p>The bypass surgery went on for six hours and was performed on Ajaib Singh's beating heart, Dr. Srivastava, the chief cardiac surgeon of BBC Heart Care, told media persons.<br />
      </p>
      <p>The patient, who was brought to the hospital in a critical condition, suffered cardiac arrest while anaesthesia was being administered and thrice during surgery, said the surgeon. However, the operation was successful and Ajaib Singh, who is a farmer from Amritsar, is making a steady and speedy recovery, added Dr srivastava.</p>
      <p>The hospital's Managing Director, Dr CS Pruthi, said after the patient was admitted, attempts were made to first stabilize his condition by administering intravenous medicines and through oxygen inhalation. He was then taken for urgent Angiography which showed 90 percent blockage in the left main coronary artery of his heart. This, in addition to other severe blocks in the right and left coronoary arteries, said Dr Pruthi, &quot;Because this condition is life-threatening, argent surgery was recommended,&quot; the doctor added.The surgery was video filmed.</p>

        <strong>Heart Surgery to 8 months old baby,Mr. Kuldeep Kumar, VPO - Sarai Khas, Teh - Kartarpur, Jalandha</strong></p>
      <p>An eight months old Baby Priya D/o Mr. Kuldeep Kumar, VPO - Sarai Khas, Teh - Kartarpur, Jalandhar with a connection between the two great arteries of the heart was operated successfully at BBC Heart Care, Pruthi Hospital, Jalandhar, on the 18 th Sept, 2004. Speaking to the media, Managing Director of Pruthi Hospital, Dr. C. S. Pruthi, told that a eight months old child who had an unusual connection between the two major arteries of the heart by birth was admitted to BBC Heart Care, Pruthi Hospital on 17 th Sept, 2004 with features of heart failure, The child had been having recurrent chest infection since birth. <br />
        <br />
      Her heart failure was controlled with medicines and the child was taken up for heart surgery. Dr. Sushant Srivastava, Chief cardiac surgeon of the hospital, operated the child on the 18 th Sept. 2004. After successful operation the child made an uneventful recovery.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sushant said a connection between the two sides of the heart is an abnormality present at birth and is referred to as congenital heart disease. This connection can be present at the level of the atria or the collecting chambers of the heart, the ventricles or the pumping chambers of the heart or the major arteries of the heart. It leads to shunting of blood from the left to the right side of the heart and compromise of the circulation of blood to vital organs of the body. A large connection between the two arteries such as was present in this child leads to excessive blood flow to the lungs at a high pressure. The result is symptoms such as breathlessness, recurrent lung infection leading to pnemmonia, and retardation of growth, If left uncorrected, later in life it can lead to permanent lung damage making the condition inoperable. Therefore, timely medical attention and surgery are necessary for best results.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sushant Srivastava further elaborated that with advancement in the techniques of cardiac surgery, hope could be offered both to the very young with birth defects of the heart and to the very old with coronary artery disease or degenerative diseases of the heart valves. Present on the occasion were other children with birth defects of the heart operated at Pruthi Hospital, To underscore the fact that successful cardiac surgery could be offered to patients at extremes of age, Mr. Ajaib Singh, a 90 yrs. old patient who had undergone bypass surgery recently at BBC Heart Care, Pruthi Hospital was also present.</p>
      <p>Dr. Anil Sood Secretary Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Punjab who was looking after the child before surgery because of the tender age was also present at the press conference.</p>    </td>
