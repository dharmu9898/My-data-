    <td><p>Located in South Mumbai and having an impeccable record of over 30 years of dedicated services to the community, Cumballa Hill Hospital has always strived to keep abreast with the latest developments in the world of medicine.</p>

In recognition of his work as a pioneer of numerous cardiac surgery procedures the Indian Association of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgeons has bestowed upon him the &quot;Life Time Achievement Award.&quot;</p>
      <p>At the onset of our venture to make Cumballa Hill Hospital one of the best hospital in Mumbai we chose cardiology as our area of specialization. Having achieved considerable success in this area we have started catering to other specialities as well.</p>
      <p>With our promise to keep abreast with the latest advances in medicine we have acquired state-of-the-art technology in Cardiology, Cardiac Surgeries and Joint Replacement Surgeries.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to establish a superspeciality center for excellent quality health care with a human touch. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
      <p>Cumballa Hill Hospital has acquired the adjacent property and now is in the process of building approx. 220 bedded multispeciality hospital with a helipad facility for Air transport. Our aim is to build one of its kind superspeciality hospital in south Mumbai extending excellent services with human touch to its patients.
