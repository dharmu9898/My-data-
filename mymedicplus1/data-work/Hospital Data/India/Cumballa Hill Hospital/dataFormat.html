    <td><p>Located in South Mumbai and having an impeccable record of over 30 years of dedicated services to the community, Cumballa Hill Hospital has always strived to keep abreast with the latest developments in the world of medicine.</p>
      <p>Dr.K.R.Shetty, the founder of Cumballa Hill Hospital, is a cardiac surgeon of international repute. In recognition of his work as a pioneer of numerous cardiac surgery procedures the Indian Association of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgeons has bestowed upon him the &quot;Life Time Achievement Award.&quot;</p>
      <p>At the onset of our venture to make Cumballa Hill Hospital one of the best hospital in Mumbai we chose cardiology as our area of specialization. Having achieved considerable success in this area we have started catering to other specialities as well.</p>
      <p>With our promise to keep abreast with the latest advances in medicine we have acquired state-of-the-art technology in Cardiology, Cardiac Surgeries and Joint Replacement Surgeries.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to establish a superspeciality center for excellent quality health care with a human touch. <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Future Plans</strong></p>
      <p>Cumballa Hill Hospital has acquired the adjacent property and now is in the process of building approx. 220 bedded multispeciality hospital with a helipad facility for Air transport. Our aim is to build one of its kind superspeciality hospital in south Mumbai extending excellent services with human touch to its patients. With Gods grace and blessing of all the loyal patients Dr. K. R. Shetty, Chairman and Medical Director, Cumballa Hill Hospital will be able to soon realize his dreams.</p>
      <p><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
      <p> &bull; To provide globally competitive healthcare of the highest quality to all segments of our population.<br />
  &bull; To assimilate the finest in medical &amp; surgical talent &amp; technique, to bring them closer to the common man.<br />
  &bull; To provide outstanding customer service to our patients from all sections of society.</p>
      <p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
      <p>It is said &ldquo;that in our dreams we see not what is, but what can be&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Ten years ago our leader and chairman of Cumballa Hill Hospital &amp; Heart Institute, Dr.K.R. Shetty predicted that South Mumbai will soon need a bigger multi speciality hospital to serve the growing population of this area. With this in mind Cumballa Hill Hospital &amp; Heart Institute has acquired the adjacent property and is now in the process of bringing to fruition our Chairman&rsquo;s dreams.</p>
      <p>&quot;That of approximately 220 bedded multi speciality hospital offering the best service and care to all patients.&quot;<br />
