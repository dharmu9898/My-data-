    <td><p>&quot;I am writing to express my delight with the work you carried on my smile!<br />
        While creating 12 new teeth for me, your advice, service and manner has been professional both technically and in skill and you have made what I dreaded into a speedy and pleasurable experience...and, at a very reasonable cost.Your whole approach has made both my wife and feel welcomed and valued.&quot;<br />

        &quot;Although I'm only 31 years old, a degenerative condition had left the majority of my teeth extremely worn. Dentists in Australia however offered me no long term solution and I was becoming increasingly embarrassed of how my teeth looked especially when smiling. In 6 visits, not only am I reaching the final stages of my treatment, but have recieved a standard of dental care not equal to, but better than any I've experienced in my home country, at an affordable price. All procedures have been pain free and in addition, I've been able to schedule all appointments at 'work friendly' times.&quot;<br />

        First of all let me thank you and your staff for the excellent serviceand the treatment I received in your clinic. Initially, when I arrived in Mumbai, I was scared about the treatment. After the firstfew minutes I was relaxed and less nervous. All of your staff was very helpful. I will always recommend your clinic to anyone who wants the dental implants. I have made one of best decision about coming to your clinic for the dental implants. I want to thank Dr. Mayuri also.Also, special thanks go to Dr.(Mrs.)Shanlini Pradhan for being very thoughtful and sending me the home cooked meal and the juices. Now I husband and my daughters are also very happy to know that I am very pleased with your clinic. They send special thanks to you too. If I can be of any help, please let me know. I am looking forward to visiting Mumbai and your clinic in few months.<br />
