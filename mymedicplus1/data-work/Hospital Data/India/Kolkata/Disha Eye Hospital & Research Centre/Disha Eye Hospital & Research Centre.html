    <td><p><strong>Disha Eye Hospital &amp; Research Centre</strong> started its journey on 1st May, 1997. Disha was born to provide high quality eye care services at an affordable cost for the patients of West Bengal as well as for the neighboring states. Optimum utilization of technology reduces the cost of treatment yet profitable, was the main thought behind the conception of Disha. Understanding this fact, Dr. Debasish Bhattacharya, the lone practitioner in the small town of Barrackpore called three of his junior friends, Dr. Tuhsar Hazra, Dr. Samar Basak &amp; Dr. Tushar Sinha to form a hospital where they want to put patient's &quot;EYE&quot; before &quot;I&quot;. The governance was technocratic; relationship with the patient was direct with the doctor. This helped the patients to build up confidence on the hospital and Disha reciprocated by providing more space for hospital services, more comfort for the patients, and newer equipments with advanced technology. Disha grew every year in terms of OPD services, in patient services and also in academic forum at state, national and international level.</p>
    <p>Quality is the most important issue which Disha promises to its patient. In Disha highest standard of service is achieved by total computerisation of record keeping and constant audit of the performances. A regular staff training schedule keeps the para medical staffs updated with equipments and functioning. For the doctors Disha organizes lectures and live surgical workshops every year. Videotaping of major surgeries on a regular basis helps us to evaluate surgical performances of the surgeons as well as helps us for teaching others. </p></td>
