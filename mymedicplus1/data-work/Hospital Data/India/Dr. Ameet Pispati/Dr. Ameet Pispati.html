    <td><p>In June 2005, I had my left hip resurfaced by Dr. Pispati at the Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai. My experience was very positive and I am happy to recommend Dr. Pispati to anyone considering resurfacing. Jaslok Hospital&rsquo;s medical facilities on the 16th floor, where foreign patients go, are excellent.</p>
      <p>I was scheduled for a total left hip replacement in California, where I live, on June 14, 2005. I planned to have this done despite being made aware by friends who had had the operation that the recovery from this operation is quite lengthy and demanding. Also, because of my insurance plan the surgery would have been free. I was 73, so I move in circles where hip problems are not uncommon. However, before that I became aware of the alternative, hip resurfacing, This surgery has recently become available in the U.S. but, because it&rsquo;s new, few surgeons are trained to do it and it&rsquo;s very expensive if you don&rsquo;t have insurance.</p>
      <p>When I became aware that the surgery is more readily available in India and is done by surgeons with considerable experience in the operation I decided to investigate that avenue, being helped in my search by my experience as a former NASA research scientist. I contacted a number of surgeons who do the operation in India and carefully examined their qualifications and experience. It was easy to make a selection. Dr. Pispati learned the resurfacing procedure from the inventor in England, was a pioneer in Asia in performing the operation, has done hundreds of hip resurfacings, has lectured on the subject to numerous other doctors, including doctors from the U.S., and has many high academic qualifications from several countries. For example, he is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in England, a very high honor as I know, since I was born there. He was also very responsive to my questions in our initial e-mail exchanges.</p>
      <p>I therefore traveled to Mumbai with my wife and had my hip resurfaced on June 8, 2005, flying home two weeks later. Everyone here, especially friends who have had the total hip replacement, has been amazed at my progress. My wife and I get much of our exercise from dancing and I began to take this up again after three weeks. I paced myself and was careful how I moved, but I could do it, gradually improving. I did the exercises given to me by the physical therapists at Jaslok. I was able to walk a couple of days after the surgery with a walker and later with a cane, but both of these I discarded after a little over a week, being able to walk unaided. I did use a cane on the flight home and also a wheelchair.</p>
      <p>Coming back, I requested a wheelchair at the airports through my travel agent to avoid long lines and waiting. I could have managed without, but it is easier with a wheelchair and you bypass all the lines. Dr. Pispati will give you a letter when you leave that allows you to get a wheelchair, but you need to request one when you book your ticket. You can make arrangements to be picked up at the airport and returned there.<br />
        I would note two aspects of the care I received at Jaslok. One is the high degree of professionalism by the staff, starting with Dr. Pispati and on down through his colleagues, other doctors, the nursing staff, and in fact all the staff. My primary goal in going to Mumbai was to get first class surgery done by a top surgeon; in both respects I met my goals. The second aspect is more intangible, but was very important to me; it was the caring attitude of the staff, especially of Dr. Pispati. Having all my questions and concerns answered was very important to me as a foreigner in a different land.<br />
        My wife was an observer of all this, since she shared my room. We both agree that Dr. Pispati is the best doctor we have ever met. I would strongly recommend him to anyone considering hip resurfacing, or any of the several other surgeries in which he is an expert.<br />
    -<strong> Mr Gordon Deboo (San Francisco, USA)</strong></p>
    <br/>
      <p>I want to thank you for sending me to Dr. Pispati. It is unbelievable how attentive and talented that man is. He really is a superb surgeon and also so very personable and likeable. He really does care about his patients and his follow up attention is unbelievable. I was awake during my operation after being anesthetized from the waist down and can tell you that every precaution imaginable was taken to prevent infection. All of my friends and relatives can't believe how fast I have recovered from surgery. Since I feel so good, I have to keep reminding myself to be careful and wait until things heal before I do certain activities.</p>
      <p>I recovered faster than most people with similar operations and I believe it was because of the really good follow up care and of course Dr. Pispati. Two days after my operation Dr. Pispati went to Thailand to teach some orthopedic surgeons about hip resurfacing and still had time to call me in my hospital room to check on me twice a day for three days and upon returning to Mumbai he went straight to the hospital first to check on his patients. He tells you exactly what he is thinking and doesn't hide any thing from his patients.</p>
    <p>The service and attention at the hospital was excellent and the physiotherapists were great. Most of the hospital staff spoke English and were very friendly and attentive. The hospital rooms are spacious with about fifteen TV stations in English and two English language newspapers delivered daily. Two physical therapists came to my room each day which would have been difficult for them if I had been in a hotel. Dr. Pispati and his intern assistants were unbelievably attentive, polite, proficient and any other superlative that I can think of. They thought of everything and anticipated my every need. I experienced no pain the whole time at the hospital and nothing but a good time.</p>
    <p>I really am glad that you found Dr. Pispati for me. I believe that he might just be the best knee and hip surgeon in the world. Well, I can't see how any surgeon could be better. I got a chance to visit a lot with three other American patients on my hospital floor and can tell you that they felt the same way about Dr. Pispati.<br />
