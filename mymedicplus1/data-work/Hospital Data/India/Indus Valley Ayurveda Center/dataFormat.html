      <p>Research - A Global Perspective <br />
      </p>
      <p>Ayurvedic research at IVAC is an ongoing effort with the purpose of making useful contributions to mainstream medicine. IVAC hopes to successfully superimpose current know-how on ancient Ayurvedic traditions without sacrificing the integrity of those traditions.</p>

A number of similar research programs have been planned for the future. This would indeed increase awareness and acceptance by the international community of Ayurveda as a valid &ldquo;science of life&rdquo;. In addition to this IVAC will give Ayurveda a truly global perspective and relevance.</p>
      <p>All research papers and findings produced at IVAC will be published in accordance with the Protocols recommended by the World Health Organization on presentations of scientific papers. <br />

      <p>&quot;I came here limping but now I am able to walk briskly. The facilities at IVAC are excellent and not only does one get well here, he also learns a lot from the healing hands and nimble fingers of the therapists.&quot; <br />

      <p><strong>Chris Kilham </strong><br />
        Author of many books on yoga and natural health says in his book Tales from the Medicine Trail</p>
      <p>&quot;India offers a broad range of choices, from the wholly unacceptable to the sublime; some places of Ayurvedic treatments are so unfortunately seamy and unsanitary as to be truly scary. At the other end of the spectrum, deep in the realm of the sublime, the IVAC offers all traditional therapies of Ayurveda, with unsurpassed amenities and attention to detail. In fact at first glance, you could mistake IVAC for a small, world class spa or an intimate, recondite lodging for the elite.&quot; <br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Bina Gupta, Brooklyn, New York, USA </strong></p>
      <p>&quot;Our experience at IVAC has been great. Our main motive in coming here was to lose weight. My husband Ganesh did very well and lost about 6 kgs in a month and that is great. I lost only 2 kgs in a month but the treatments cured my insomnia which I have suffered for several years and could not be treated by doctors in the US. Now I am able to sleep very well.<br />
        We plan to return soon for 2 more weeks.&quot;. <br />

      <p><strong>Dr. Susan Hoyt Clinical Psychologist, USA </strong></p>
      <p>&quot;My stay at Indus Valley Ayurvedic Centre was very pleasurable and relaxing and rejuvenating experience which was remarkably healing for the mind, body and soul. The staff are exceptional and dedicated to making one's stay as pleasant and healing as possible. &quot;. <br />

      <p>'I found there was a real Ayurvedic center, IVAC, in Mysore. It is not commercialised but genuine. It was a wonderful experience, which gave me power and youth. The facilities are of international standards and one feels very safe in a family environment. There is a presence of softness, purity and care in the people, the treatments and the facilities.&quot; <br />

      </p>
      <p><strong>Dr.Joanna Herman- Germany </strong></p>
      <p>&quot;I am really glad I did the panchakarma at Indus Valley Ayurvedic Centre and have felt really good since. It was amazing what it did to my yoga - I was so light and bendy afterwards that postures that have been eluding me for ages seemed to just come easily. The masseurs were thorough with their strokes and the treatment rooms were spotless. I also have to mention the Ayurvedic food, which was quite consistently delicious on all days of my stay.&quot; <br />

      <p>Hello Dr Krishna,<br />
        Thank you very much for your kind message. I hope that you had a very<br />
        good Christmas yourself. I hope that you are still planning on visiting us in South Africa. My inlaws went to India a month ago and spent about 9 days<br />
        at your Ayurvedic center in Mysore. They had a really wonderful time there and have come home thoroughly rejuvenated.</p>
      <p>Regards,<br />
        Khushma Mehta <br />

      <p>&quot;This is my second visit to IVAC in six months for the treatment of my daughter. I will never forget the things I have experienced here in my lifetime. I would always recommend this Ayurveda Centre to all my friends and relatives. It is Paradise.</p>
      <p>I highly appreciate the personalized service given by the doctors and in particular the staff working here. By seeing that smile and politeness on all the faces, you feel half the battle is over. </p>
    <p>Last but not the least the food at this center is excellent.&quot; </p></td>
