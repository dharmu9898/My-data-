      <p>Research - A Global Perspective <br />
      </p>
      <p>Ayurvedic research at IVAC is an ongoing effort with the purpose of making useful contributions to mainstream medicine. IVAC hopes to successfully superimpose current know-how on ancient Ayurvedic traditions without sacrificing the integrity of those traditions.</p>
      <p>IVAC has committed substantial resources into Ayurveda research. For the first time IVAC is a part of a collaborative research program with Vikram hospital and Heart Care, Mysore and the University of Maryland, USA on the study and prevention of childhood obesity. A number of similar research programs have been planned for the future. This would indeed increase awareness and acceptance by the international community of Ayurveda as a valid &ldquo;science of life&rdquo;. In addition to this IVAC will give Ayurveda a truly global perspective and relevance.</p>
    <p>All research papers and findings produced at IVAC will be published in accordance with the Protocols recommended by the World Health Organization on presentations of scientific papers. </p></td>

      <p>I came here limping but now I am able to walk briskly. The facilities at IVAC are excellent and not only does one get well here, he also learns a lot from the healing hands and nimble fingers of the therapists.</p>
      <p><br />
      <strong>Chris Kilham</strong></p>
      <p>Author of many books on yoga and natural health says in his book Tales from the Medicine Trail</p>
      <p>India offers a broad range of choices, from the wholly unacceptable to the sublime; some places of Ayurvedic treatments are so unfortunately seamy and unsanitary as to be truly scary. At the other end of the spectrum, deep in the realm of the sublime, the IVAC offers all traditional therapies of Ayurveda, with unsurpassed amenities and attention to detail. In fact at first glance, you could mistake IVAC for a small, world class spa or an intimate, recondite lodging for the elite.</p>
      <p><br />
      <strong>Bina Gupta, Brooklyn, New York, USA </strong></p>
      <p>Our experience at IVAC has been great. Our main motive in coming here was to lose weight. My husband Ganesh did very well and lost about 6 kgs in a month and that is great. I lost only 2 kgs in a month but the treatments cured my insomnia which I have suffered for several years and could not be treated by doctors in the US. Now I am able to sleep very well.<br />
      We plan to return soon for 2 more weeks</p>

      </p>
      <p>I found there was a real Ayurvedic center, IVAC, in Mysore. It is not commercialised but genuine. It was a wonderful experience, which gave me power and youth. The facilities are of international standards and one feels very safe in a family environment. There is a presence of softness, purity and care in the people, the treatments and the facilities.<br />
