Ultra modern, sophisticated, well-furnished designer rooms on the Executive floor offer 5-star comfort and luxury to add to the exclusive KIMS care and experience.

      This is one of the cleanest hospitals I have seen. I have found the standard of care to be second to none. The staffs are professional, caring and very friendly, everyone- room service, cleaning, administration, and doctors last but not least, nurses, have been wonderful to me. Thank you all very much<br />
      <br />
      <strong>William &amp; Barbara Howell</strong><br />
      <strong>Colorado, USA</strong><br />
      KIMS, to our observation, is the finest hospital experience we have had anywhere. The clarity of the doctors and their professionalism and dignity, the hospitality and the generous nature of the amiable nurses, the pain free experience, even after leaving the hospital, the ease of gaining a professional consultation and medical test, the rapidity of receiving results of medical test, the best hospital food we have experienced and last but not least, the excellence of the entire staff of KIMS International Patient Relations, for all of these elements congealing into an amazing wholeness of medical ease and excellence, we humbly say thank you.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Sabira Somji<br />
      Dubai, UAE</strong><br />
      I have no words to describe the wonderful experience at KIMS. It all began with the efficient and prompt email communication with the international patient relations department. Right from the time we arrived at the Trivandrum airport we were well taken care of. A few days of sight seeing and backwater houseboat rides were also arranged just before the surgery. The enthusiasm and friendliness of the staff, doctors, nurses, pantry, cleaning and most of all, IPR, is amazing.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Bernard Bewesy<br />
      Rockford, UK</strong><br />
      Thank you for your excellent care. Every member of staff were competent, courteous, compassionate and professional in their care. The cleanliness of the hospital is superb, England's hospitals needs to see at KIMS<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Gokselin Acar<br />
      Essen, Germany</strong><br />
      I say &quot;Thank you&quot; for your excellent care and treatment in this hospital. The staff, surgeon, nurses are very friendly as well as qualified. The meals are delicious. All tests and reports punctual. My stay was very pleasant. Thank you.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>James Clark<br />
      London, UK</strong><br />
      I had a medical issue that was not spotted in the UK despite having seen the appropriate doctors. The issue became much worse in India and I was very worried. Everyone recommended KIMS and I have been amazed at the first class service and care offered to me here. I would recommend it to anyone. Better than a UK hospital!!!<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Mohd Abdulla Rahman<br />

      KIMS is an excellent hospital. We are fully satisfied with your services. Special mention must be made about the cleaning and the friendly staff. KIMS is well known in the Gulf for its International standards. All the best<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Nadeem Walji<br />
      Toronto, Canada</strong><br />
      The service and friendliness of everyone at this hospital is incredible. I feel like everyone is more of a friend than a staff member. The nurses are so great as well as the doctors and therapists. I have never had such an enjoyable time in a hospital in my life.. Everyone here is genuinely nice and don't have that fake 'Have a nice day' attitude. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Amanda Conway<br />
      Lusaka, Zambia</strong><br />
      My husband and I had minor problems in dental, lower back and eyes. We have been treated very well by all staff and the level of efficiency is high. Equipment is first class and most importantly the exclusive International desk at KIMS makes your appointment and life in the hospital an absolute breeze.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Harold Whitehead<br />
      California, USA</strong><br />
      KIMS is excellent - the staff, doctors, rooms and food are superb. My every need was met with kindness and patience and I was comfortable 100% of the time. I will recommend all my friends to come to KIMS for all elective procedures. Keep up the good work.<br />
      <br />

      We cannot express how grateful we are to all the staff at KIMS for the safe and careful attention given to us throughout our stay. We appreciate your professionalism and concern. The International centre has a great team. Blessings to all.<br />

      KIMS saved my life. My second birth on 19-11-2007 after an MI. Thank you for my new life and second chance. KIMS is excellent with its kind and compassionate staff.<br />

      Didn't know that facilities like this exsisted here in India. Very thorough investigations and care. Hope the treatment back home is as good!<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Sian Jones<br />
      Paris, France</strong><br />
      I came to KIMS for a procedure which was a bit worrying - but I need not have been anxious as everyday was great. I certainly will recommend this hospital to all friends and colleagues. Thank you to all the staff, they do an excellent job. The food could do with some attention.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Anthony Cox<br />
      Suffolk, UK</strong><br />
      I have visited many hospitals but KIMS has to be one of the finest anywhere in the world. From the International desk to the private executive room, service and hospitality has been excellent. I would highly recommend KIMS to all. Once again many thanks for your help.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Dr.Ahmad Robert Vogel<br />
      Berlin, Germany</strong><br />
      I found in KIMS immediately the medical help I was looking for since some time. I shall not hesitate to recommend this outstanding hospital to friends and relatives. All my compliments to everybody whom I met here as doctors and staff.<br />
