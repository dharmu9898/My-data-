      This is one of the cleanest hospitals I have seen. I have found the standard of care to be second to none. The staffs are professional, caring and very friendly, everyone- room service, cleaning, administration, and doctors last but not least, nurses, have been wonderful to me. Thank you all very much<br />
      <br />
      <strong>William &amp; Barbara Howell</strong><br />

      KIMS, to our observation, is the finest hospital experience we have had anywhere. The clarity of the doctors and their professionalism and dignity, the hospitality and the generous nature of the amiable nurses, the pain free experience, even after leaving the hospital, the ease of gaining a professional consultation and medical test, the rapidity of receiving results of medical test, the best hospital food we have experienced and last but not least, the excellence of the entire staff of KIMS International Patient Relations, for all of these elements congealing into an amazing wholeness of medical ease and excellence, we humbly say thank you.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Sabira Somji<br />
      Dubai, UAE</strong><br />
      I have no words to describe the wonderful experience at KIMS. It all began with the efficient and prompt email communication with the international patient relations department. Right from the time we arrived at the Trivandrum airport we were well taken care of. A few days of sight seeing and backwater houseboat rides were also arranged just before the surgery. The enthusiasm and friendliness of the staff, doctors, nurses, pantry, cleaning and most of all, IPR, is amazing.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Bernard Bewesy<br />
      Rockford, UK</strong><br />
      Thank you for your excellent care. Every member of staff were competent, courteous, compassionate and professional in their care. The cleanliness of the hospital is superb, England's hospitals needs to see at KIMS<br />
