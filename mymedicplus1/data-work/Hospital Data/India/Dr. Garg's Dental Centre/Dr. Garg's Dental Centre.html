    <td><p><strong>FILLINGS</strong><br />
        A cavity calls for your dentist to remove the decay and to fill in the tooth area that was removed in order to prevent further decay and strengthen the affected tooth. There have been lots of advances in modern dentistry that make this process much more comfortable and use materials that are safer and more esthetically pleasing.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>SILVER FILLINGS</strong><br />
        Earlier the trend was to have amalgam fillings (silver) or gold filling restorations. These fillings contain mercury which is poisonous to the body as well as the environment. Also the amalgam fillings are generally not as advantageous as composite fillings because they demand more of a tooth removal and are susceptible to corrosion.</p>
      <p><strong>COMPOSITE FILLINGS (Tooth-coloured)</strong><br />
        Composite FillingsComposite resin dental fillings were created as an alternative to traditional metal dental fillings. Tooth fillings colored to look like a natural tooth are known as Composite Resin Dental Fillings and are made of a plastic dental resin combined with glass particles. These types of fillings are, durable and are way more natural looking than amalgam fillings.If you have a cavity in a tooth or broken fillings or if your teeth are full of silver fillings you may want to ask your dentist about changing to composite dental fillings. Silver fillings can easily be removed and replaced with far more attractive colored fillings. Research shows that composite fillings actually strengthen your tooth and further protect it from decay.</p>
      <p><strong>Dental care for kids (Pediatric Dentistry)</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Treatment</strong>:Psychological approach: It is generally said that children lacking parental care, love and affection resort to this habit. Thus the parents should provide the child with adequate love and affection. Also the child's attention be diverted to other things as games and toys. The dentist and the parents should together work to motivate the child to discontinue the habit.</p>
      <p><strong>Mechanical Aids</strong>: They are basically reminding appliances that assist the child who is willing to quit the habit but is not able to do so as the habit has entered the subconscious level. They may be removable or fixed appliances.<br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>GUM DISEASES</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Treatment</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Non-surgical treatment involves scaling and polishing of teeth. The procedure aims to remove food particles, plaque and calculus accumulating around the tooth. The effectiveness of the procedure depends largely on the stage of the disease, the efficiency of instrumentation and the maintenance on the part of the patient.</li>
        <li>The Surgical approach to treatment is usually recommended for resistant cases where complete removal of the irritants from root surface of the tooth is not possible by scaling alone due to the deep penetration of the deposits. The procedure also called as flap surgery or flap operation involves reflection of the gums by 1-1 1/2 mm and debriding the area under local anesthesia with direct visualization of the deposits. The procedure is completely painless and involves minimum post-operative pain or discomfort.</li>
        <li>In certain cases however it is possible to regrow the lost bone by use of certain bone substitutes called Bone grafts. Such cases provide the ideal outcome of therapy by regenerating the lost tissues.</li>

    <td><p><strong>Uli Wippler, Craniosacral therapist, Germany.</strong></p>
      <p>I got 12 teeth replaced by metal free crowns and bridges. I felt 100% safe with the clinic cleanliness. I was impressed by the fact that there were always 4 eyes (Father and son) watching me. Both the doctors were great.</p>
      <p>After getting a part of treatment done in April 07, I again came back in Jan, 08 to get my other teeth fixed. Have you ever seen anybody enjoying the dental treatment!!?!!&rdquo;</p>
      
      <p><br/><strong>John Austin, Lawyer, USA<br />
      Got a full mouth rehabilitation with 27 crowns and 2 implants</strong>.</p>
      <p>The doctor&rsquo;s attitude was very positive and honest. I also liked having second doctor (father) look in on the work from time to time. I was also impressed by the flexibility of timings: willingness of doctors to work odd hours and to accommodate schedules for getting me some sightseeing.</p>
      <p><br/><strong>Charles Buchanan, Documentary film maker, USA<br />
      Got a cosmetic smile designing, implants, a bridge, tooth whitening, root canal etc.</strong></p>
      <p>&ldquo;The cleanliness in the clinic was never a worry. Inside the clinic is a totally different world from the street outside. Dr. Nimit Garg is professional, courteous and above all, genuinely concerned to do the very best for his patients. I knew I was in the hands of someone who takes his craft seriously.. I also enjoyed the music at the clinic- it helped me relax.</p>
      <p>I would ( and have, and will) recommend Dr. Garg to anyone&rdquo;.</p>
      <p><br/><strong>Annie O&rsquo;todle, cook, Australia<br />
        Underwent a surgery for removal of impacted tooth.</strong></p>
      <p>The doctor&rsquo;s attitude was very professional and competent. I was extremely anxious and nervous when I first came to know about it and since then I was postponing it. But the swiftness and the painless operation was something that really impressed me. Best of luck to Dr. Garg and his team.</p>
      <p><br/><strong>Ivor wolfe, Optometrist, UK.<br />
        Got a smile makeover.</strong></p>
      <p>My anterior teeth were so crooked and discoloured that I could not give a broad smile. When I first stepped in I had apprehensions about the final outcome. Impressed by the level of equipment and competency of the dentist I decided to go on. I am extremely happy with the final outcome and would recommend the dentist<br />
