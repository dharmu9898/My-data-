    <td><p><strong>Niramaya Ayurveda</strong></p>
      <p>Ayurveda, a well recognized system of medicine has unique techniques for harmonious living. These acknowledged techniques underwent revision and advancements in the flow of time. Out of such advancements in medical science, Panchakarma therapies are the foremost and Kerala has made its own platform due to the immense contribution made by the Ashtavaidyas and other traditional practitioners. Kerala&rsquo;s then political system also were very keen in preserving this valuable science. By them, parallel to the main stream &ldquo;Keraleeya Panchakarma&rdquo;, a modified form of therapies evolved which was well revised by various doyens. Now those exclusive therapies are opening to all for the expansion of the science.</p>
