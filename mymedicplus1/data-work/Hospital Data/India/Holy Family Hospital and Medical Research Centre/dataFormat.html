    <td><p><strong>HISTORY OF BANDRA HOLY FAMILY HOSPITAL &amp; RESEARCH CENTRE</strong><br />
    </p>
      <p><strong>ORIGINS AND EVALUATION</strong></p>
      <p>Dr.da silva, served the community of Bandra from a small nursing home. He was general practitioner, obstetrician and gynaecologist as well as a surgeon of no mean competence. &quot;Silverene&quot;, became a Bandra landmark and legend.</p>
      <p>The Medical Mission Sisters with Sr.Alma as the head, continued the tradition, under the new title of &quot;Holy Family Hospital&quot;, with a special zeal.</p>
      <p>Still, as Bandra grew, so too, did its health requirements. An increase in bed strength and facilities became the need of the hour. The Medical Mission Sisters were ready to hand over the hospital to the Archbishop of Bombay. They had indeed even prepared an excellent survey of the community health needs and the pattern of service component required.</p>
      <p>The far sighted Cardinal Gracias searched for any Religious order, to take up the challenge which the Ursulines of Mary Immaculate accepted. A new step of development was set in motion.</p>
      <p>A concerted drive for funds started, both locally and abroad. These were generously forthcoming. Those from abroad were largely the efforts of Sister Maria Alberoni, affectionately known as &quot;Mother Giovanna&quot;.</p>
      <p>A new building of four floors, soon to be extended to five, came into existence. The New Holy Family Hospital and its Research center was well under way. The idea of research centre was quickly accepted by Mother Giovanna, a doctor herself, who knew that good medical care as well as scientific evaluation was necessary both as a discipline as well as a means for sharpening facilities and efficiency.</p>
      <p>Thus today, the hospital provides high quality and affordable care, possessing the most up to date facilities and a staff of some of the most experienced and competent in the city.</p>
      <p>Apart from the main divisions of any general hospital, it now has extended specialities of ophthalmology, ear nose and throat surgery, orthopedic and pediatric surgery. High quality endoscopy is available for the diagnostic as well as operative surgery. The medical specialities include pediatrics, cardiology, respiratory medicine and a third envisaged. Neurology and neurosurgery are both taken care of, the former with regular OPD Clinic. With an eye to holistic medicine, there are also clinic with qualified homeopaths and an acupuncturist and acupressurist.</p>
      <p>Well reputed ICU and NICU and up to date audiology service make this a most well rounded health care centre. The excellent imaging department includes IITV and CT Scanning. An Ultra sound section is used not only for body scanning, but also for echo cardiography. The pathology laboratory takes care of biochemistry, largely computerized, microbiology and histopathology and cytology.</p>
      <p>The Research Centre has been recognized by the Department of Science and Technology of the Govt. of India, enabling donors to avail of 100% deduction. Its projects extend from fertility awareness and natural family planning to evaluation of hospital facilities like the value of endoscopic surgery, its pros and cons, as well as studies on hospital post operative infection. Two major and prestigious projects have been</p>
      <p>1) A multicentric study of leads levels in blood in targeted groups, part of an sponsored by the George Foundation.<br />
        2) An Alzheimer's study better known as a dementia research and service project which has a multipronged approach consisting of a large demographic survey, genetic studies, a program for training of carers and a proposed drug trials. This projects put out its own Newsletter. Two important national Seminars on the Ageing Brain, co-sponsored by the Holy Family Medical Research centre, and the FIAMC Bio-Medical Ethics Centre have been held, with participants from medical, legal, sociological and ethical fields. The Research Centre has also been holding regular monthly CME and Clinical Update programmes for Hospital Staff and general Practitioners, Consultants of the surrounding Community served by this Hospital.</p>
      <p>Our staff have not been lacking in publications which have won even international awards and acclaim. One of the latest Hospital has been the introduction of a Cancer Detection and Awareness Clinic as well as Osteoporosis and Menopause Clinic..</p>
      <p><strong>EQUIPMENTS USED :</strong></p>
      <p>We have all the latest Equipments in our OT from the latest Multi National Companies, Few of the Equipments which we are using are as below:</p>
      <p>Dr&auml;ger has been at the forefront of anesthesia system design for over 100 years. The Fabius GS anesthesia system is the latest development in the evolution of anesthesia technology. Designed for routine anesthesia practice, the Fabius GS combines the latest ventilation and gas delivery technologies with an intuitive and familiar user interface.</p>
      <p><strong>Fabius GS Features</strong></p>
      <p>Fabius GS is a Simply Smarter anesthesia solution because it integrates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> an ergonomic design of all components<br />
          </li>
        <li> an economical and upgradable architecture<br />
          </li>
        <li> an intelligent safety concept<br />
          </li>
        <li>an optimized workstation structure<br />
          </li>
        <li> a simple and intuitive user interface<br />
          </li>
        <li> a highly advanced ventilator<br />
        </li>
        <li> an innovative gas delivery module</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The highly sophisticated Oxylog 2000 ventilator combines the advantages of larger intensive care ventilators with the compact dimensions of small transport and emergency ventilators. With four ventilation modes, an integrated PEEP valve and a variable I:E ratio, both non-breathing and spontaneously breathing patients receive optimum ventilation with the Oxylog 2000.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Additional features include the integrated CPR mode, comprehensive airway monitoring and a real-time minute volume measurement which is carried out close to the patient - unique for ventilators in this class.</p>
      <p>Stella &ndash; Lighting your way</p>
      <p>The Stella illumination concept is designed with user&rsquo;s needs in mind. Because the light is distributed throughout a long homogeneous light cylinder, there is no need to focus. Further more light intensity from 80.000 lux up to 160.000 lux and depth illumination can be adjusted personally by the surgeon.</p>
      <p>Like a double star whose two stars are close together and as balls of gas change their brightness, Stella has two optical systems in a single body. They are joined on at an optical axis, each with its own lenses, filters and reflectors. And, the system combines halogen and gas discharge technology. While the gas discharge lamp generates large-area, shadow-free and depth illumination, the halogen lamp provides an additional high-contrast depth illumination. As a result, the system is able to evenly illuminate both the area surrounding the wound and deep into the situs, supporting stereoscopic vision and preventing disturbing shadows.</p>
      <p>Conditions for optimal color recognition are created by the high, identical 4200 Kelvin color temperature of both light systems of, as well as the light cylinder<br />
        (230 mm constant light field diameter x 1300 mm length). Tissue layers are more easily distinguished from each other. </p>
