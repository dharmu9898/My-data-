      <p><strong>Root Canal Treatment consists of:</strong></p>
      <p> The removal of the infected or irritated nerve tissue that lies within the root of the tooth. It is this infected pulp tissue that causes an eventual abscess.</p>
      <p> The first step in a root canal is to obtain access to the nerve. This is accomplished by establishing a small access opening in the top of the tooth. It will be done under a local anesthetic.</p>
      <p> The length of the root canal is determined and the infected pulp is removed.</p>
      <p> At the same visit, the canal where the nerve is located will be reshaped and prepared to accept a special root canal filling material. The number of visits necessary to complete your root canal will depend upon several factors including the number of nerves in the tooth, the infected state of the nerve, and the complexity of the procedure.</p>
      <p> The final step in your root canal will be the sealing of the root canal with a sterile, plastic material called gutta percha. This is done in order to prevent possible future infection.</p>
      <p> If treated early, root canal therapy need not be uncomfortable. With the use of local anesthetics, the entire procedure can be totally painless.</p>
      <p>Teeth Whitening<br />
        Bleaching</p>
      <p><strong>Gum Treatment &amp;<br />
        Surgeries<br />
        Non-Surgical Therapy</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>  Scaling and Root Planing: Manually removing the plaque and tarter from the root surfaces of your teeth below the gum line.<br />
          </li>
        <li>Antibiotics: Because bacteria cause periodontitis antibiotics may be prescribed as pills or as an Antibiotic fiber. The fibers are used in conjunction with scaling and root planing. They are placed directly into the pockets and are removed within 7-10 days later. Antibacterial mouth rinses may also be recommended to help plaque control.<br />
          </li>
        <li>Bite correction: An imbalanced bite may accelerate bone destruction. Your teeth may be adjusted for proper and better function. A Bite-guard (removable retainer fitting over teeth) may be required to protect teeth surfaces and relax tense muscles.<br />
          </li>
        <li>Splinting: This technique attaches weak teeth together, combining them into a stronger single unit, making them more stable and offering more comfortable chewing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Surgical Therapy</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flap Surgery: Our periodontist separates the gum from the teeth creating a &quot;flap&quot; and accesses the infected pocket. It aims to reduce pocket depth and increase the ability to maintain the remnant pockets clean.<br />
          </li>
        <li>Gingivectomy: This procedure is performed when excess amounts of gum growth around the teeth have occurred. This results in false pocket formation and the inability to keep them clean.<br />
          </li>
        <li> Osseous (bone) surgery: This procedure is done to smooth shallow craters and defects in the bone due to mild or moderate bone loss. Guided Tissue Regeneration: This procedure is done in combination with a surgical flap operation where gum growth into a defect is barriered off to allow slower growing bone, cementum and ligament cells to populate a bony defect.<br />
          </li>
        <li>Bone Grafts: Tiny fragments of the patient's bone, synthetic bone or bone obtained from a bone bank are used to fill a bony defect around the teeth. These grafts act as a scaffold on or around which patients own bone is conducted or induced to grow.<br />
          </li>
        <li> Soft Tissue Graft: In cases of gum recession a graft is usually taken from the palate and transplanted onto the receding area to reinforce the thin gum and to inhibit further gum recession.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Flap and Bone Surgery</strong></p>
      <p>When gum is inflamed severely (periodontitis), alveolar bone will be absorbed, and defected. Periodontal ligaments which connect between the alveolar bone and the teeth will disappear. Sever bone lose will cause tooth moving and missing. Flap and bone surgery is order to contour the bone, deeply clean the tooth to reduce the inflammation, and promote bone re-growing and connections firm.<br />

      <p>We heard about your clinic by searching on the Internet. Also you were one of a very few who would return our emails. The taxi drivers did have some trouble in finding your clinic, but it could have been the language difference too.</p>
      <p> The appointments were set and I appreciated the accommodations. The treatment I had was Dental implant, root canals, crowns. What I liked from the treatment was the final outcome. What I did not like was some of the pain that came with the extractions. More so after I left the clinic.All my questions were answered and explained and you and your staff were very courteous.</p>
      <p>General cleanliness and interior was great, music and everything was great.  I would recommend you to any of my friends or family that were interested in getting new teeth.</p>

        As a model, confidence is everything and before I came to see you my teeth were my biggest insecurity. Dr.Kathurias were so understanding and confident in what needed to be done that I automatically felt relaxed. Within 2 weeks I had my perfect teeth and its all down to Dr.Puneet &amp; Dr.Sween&rsquo;s effort and hard work. I now feel my confidence has risen and I want any excuse to smile! The icing on the cake was when I went for a commercial shoot and was told by the director that I should be in a Colgate advert!! I never thought I would be complimented on my teeth, I never thought I would smile so much without worrying. And here I am smiling away. Thank you so much for everything.&quot;<br />
