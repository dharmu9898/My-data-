    <td><p>We have been providing periodontal specialty services in Panama since 1962.  Dr. Rodrigo Eisenmann obtained a Master in Science Degree and Periodontal Specialty Certificate from Loyola University of Chicago, becoming the first periodontist in Panama.  45 years of experience makes a difference&hellip;</p>
      <p><strong>Dr Gabriela Eisenmann</strong> joined the clinic after completion of her Specialty in Periodontics at Loyola Dental School in 1989. In 1994 she was the first LatinAmerican woman to earn the Diplomate status of the American Board Periodontology.</p>
      <p>In order to provide a comprehensive dental attention to our patients we included a General Dentist in our staff to fulfill all your dental needs at the same location.  Dr. Erasmo Arias joined us in 1996 and later on Dr Dennis T. Lindo.  Both Dr. Arias and Lindo have many years of experience in cosmetic and general dentistry.  Together we are able to provide you and your family with top quality dental services in Panama, equivalent to the highest U. S. standards</p>
      <p>In 1987 we placed the first dental implant in our practice, almost 20 years later following the success of this revolutionary trend in dentistry we feel very confident of our clinical experience in this field.</p>
      <p>We firmly believe in the need of keeping up with all the scientific advances in Dentistry and we make time for the continuing education of all the members of our team.  It is our responsibility.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to offer you dental services in a comfortable and friendly environment.</p>
      <p>Welcome!</p>

    <td><p>Hi Dr.Eisenmann,<br />
      Daniel came back from the dental implant surgery and acted like he had just had a routine cleaning. He has not taken any meds and no complaints of pain and has very minimal swelling.<br />
      Great job.<br />
      Thanks<br />
      <strong>June</strong><br />

      <p><br />Dear Drs. Eisenmanns,<br />
        I cannot thank you enough for your assistance yesterday. An evening gown and no teeth is a gruesome scenario for an L.A. girl, even an old one. We were delighted to meet the family and visit with you. It's the only time a visit to a dentist became the high point of a visit to a country.....we shall no longer reference the Panama canal but your family. Again <br />
        please call us if you find yourselves in Los Angeles.<br />
        <strong>Muchas Gracias, L. and M. Flynn</strong></p></td>
