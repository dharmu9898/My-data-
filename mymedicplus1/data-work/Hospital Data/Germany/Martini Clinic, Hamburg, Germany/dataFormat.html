    <td><p>The Martini Clinic in the campus of the University Clinic  Hamburg-Eppendorf is specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of  prostate cancer. We put our hearts into the health and rapid recovery  of our patients. To enable this, we offer all established therapy  forms, based on the latest research discoveries. One focus of treatment  is on nerve-preserving removal of the prostate gland, which has an  extremely positive influence on the consequences of this radical  operation. Our experienced surgeons are among the best-known experts  world-wide in this field. In the pleasant surroundings of our private  clinic, they make sure that the quality of our patients' lives is  preserved.</p>
      <h2>Specialization on prostate cancer</h2>
      <p>The modern, up-to-date Martini-Klinik for prostate  cancer was created on the grounds of the University Medical Center  Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE). This specialization, patterned after the  American model, is unique in Germany. Patient health always represents  the center of all our work. Patients receive treatment tailored to  their individual needs. International experts,&nbsp;the<strong> doctors</strong>` and <strong>care team</strong> of Professor Dr. Hartwig Huland, Professor Dr. Markus Graefen&nbsp;and  Professor Dr. Hans Heinzer&nbsp;take care of each individual patient (during  his treatment for prostate cancer). Besides its excellent medical  service, the particularly pleasant atmosphere at the Martini Clinic  helps to accelerate the recovery process. </p>
      <h2>Comfortable ambience</h2>
      <p>As we know, only patients comfortable after an  operation can be discharged and return home as soon as possible. Thus,  we offer medical excellence and comfort which meet the highest  expectations. This starts at the reception area, where dark leather  armchairs and walls and pillars in warm shades of brown ensure an  atmosphere which conveys trust and shelter from the very first moment.  We have consciously chosen a hotel character to make the recovery phase  as pleasant as possible. The Martini-Klinik provides single and double  rooms with high-comfort beds and a built-in bathroom with shower.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Surgical methods</strong></p>
    <p>The Martini-Klinik offers &rdquo;classical&rdquo; surgical removal of the prostate known as radical retropubic prostatectomy. In this procedure the surgeon removes the prostate manually.</p>
    <p>The second option offered for radical prostatectomy at the Martini-Klinik is minimally invasive surgery with the da Vinci&reg; surgical system. With this modern laparoscopic OP system the surgeon does the procedure using a surgical robot to which microsurgical instruments and a three-dimensional camera system are attached. </p>
    <p><strong>Care in the prostate cancer center<br />
      Nursing care</strong></p>
    <p>The Martini-Klinik team is trained to help individual patients with urological problems. This applies to our management as well as to our medical and nursing staff, who have been specially trained to take care of our patients by meeting the highest standards of care. The goal we all share is to give patients our time, attentive care and a feeling of security. One of the services we offer includes a catering expert who has a special responsibility for each individual&acute;s requirements regarding daily meals.</p>
    <p>During the first careful steps after an operation, no patient is left alone. A nurse is at his side to help and support him.<br />
      Medical care</p>
    <p>Behind every successful course of treatment in a clinic there are always excellent doctors. Only specialists with many years of surgical experience and an outstanding reputation work in the Martini-Klinik. The Medical Directors Professor Hartwig Huland,  Professor Dr. Markus Graefen and Professor Dr. Hans Heinzer and their doctors` team are among the best-known surgeons in the field of nerve-preserving radical prostatectomy in Europe. Together with the doctors` team and universitary partners, they have performed and improved this particularly difficult operation over 8,500 times.</p>
    <p>Furthermore the assistant medical directors of the Martini-Klinik are additionally specialized deeper in one area of prostate cancer: </p>
    <p>Dr. Georg Salomon: modern imaging techniques (Martini-Konsult Diagnostik)</p>
    <p>Dr. Thorsten Schlomm: Martini-Konsult Zweitmeinung as offer of an independent second second expert opinion </p>
    <p>PD Dr. Alexander Haese: prostate removal with da Vinci&reg; surgical system</p>
    <p>PD Dr. Thomas Steuber: advanced prostate carcinoma<br />
    </p>
    <p>The brachytherapy has already been made more than 1,600 times together with the specialists of the Ambulanzzentrum des UKE GmbH, section radio-oncology.</p>
    <p>Beyond their clinical expertise, the doctors of the Martini-Klinik are active researchers and their close connection to patient care allows that innovations in therapy or diagnostics directly influence daily practice.</p>
    <h1>Guiding principle</h1>
    <p>In accordance with our guiding  principle, each person is an individual entitled to the care that reflects his  individuality. Our work is centered on both physical and psychological  recovery. It is important for us to encourage our patients and their families  to actively take part in this process.<br />
    The respect of rights of each individual is the principle that applies to the  entire team of the Martini Clinic. In our professional life we respect and  support each other, but we are also critical of ourselves. Our guiding  principle commits us to offering each patient the best possible treatment based  on the latest scientific developments and the results of our own research and  the research of others. Latest achievements are critically assessed by our  surgeons before being used in the routine treatment. Thus, we continuously  invest in the quality of our service in order to deliver our patients the best possible  treatment.</p></td>
