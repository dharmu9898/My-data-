    <td><p><strong>Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein</strong> relies on qualified human resources, state-of-the-art equipment and, more importantly, attention, respect and agility to offer quality health care. We are prepared to tailor our services to the needs of each and every patient to guarantee excellence and a positive experience.</p>
    <p>With respect and professionalism, HIAE achieved a leading position in Latin America.

The principle of continuous improvement and excellence is shared among all those who contribute to our work, from medical staff to scientists and management.</p>
    <p><strong>History</strong></p>
    <p>In 1955, a group of idealists from the Jewish community of S&atilde;o Paulo founded Sociedade Beneficente Israelita Brasileira Albert Einstein (SBIBAE), based upon four traditional Jewish principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good Deeds (Mitzv&aacute;)<br />
        </li>
      <li>Health, Healing (Refu&aacute;)<br />
        </li>
      <li>Education (Chinuch)<br />
        </li>
      <li>Solidarity, Justice (Tsedak&aacute;)</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>Over half a century later, SBIBAE has become a great and modern institution, governed by high quality standards and in tune with the most advanced technologies available.</p></td>
