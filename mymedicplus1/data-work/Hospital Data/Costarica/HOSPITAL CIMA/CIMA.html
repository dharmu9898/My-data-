    <td><p>Consorcio  Hospital Internacional, S.A de C.V. (CHI) was incorporated in 1992 with the  vision of establishing, in Mexico as well as in Latin America, a premier private  medical services provider. Consorcio Internacional Hospital is the Mexican  affiliate of International Hospital Corporation, company headquartered in  Dallas, Texas. This consortium invests in, operates and markets hospitals, who  work under the name of Centro Internacional de Medicina (CIMA). CHI also  operated hospitals in Brazil under the VITA name.<br />
      CIMA&rsquo;s main  objective is to have specialized hospitals. All CIMA hospitals include  departments like emergency, surgery, internal medicine, diagnostic areas,  pediatrics and ob-gyn; they also offer intensive care for adults, children  including newborns, and high-complexity specialties such as cardiology and  neurology. Some centers also offer preventative health care, physical  rehabilitation premises and medical practice office buildings.<br />
      CIMA  hospitals offer their services at:</p>
      <p>&bull; CIMA  Hermosillo<br />
  &bull; CIMA  Chihuahua<br />
  &bull; CIMA San  Jos&eacute; de Costa Rica<br />
  &bull; CIMA  Santa Engracia<br />
        There will  soon be another CIMA in Puebla. CIH provides the highest quality in private  medical care to Latin and South America. So, now and in the future, CIMA and  VITA will continue to represent the pinnacle of private medical care. </p>
    <p>Medical  Travel describes a rapidly growing practice of traveling to another country to  obtain medical services.<br />
Since the  exponential growth of travel for healthcare, our hospitals have found the need  to aid International Patients by being directly involved with the patient&rsquo;s  personal needs before, during and after they receive care in the CIMA and VITA  hospitals.<br />
Although  there are many healthcare providers trying to capitalize on this growing trend,  most only provide local hospital services. Few can provide personalized service  packages that include travel, hotel accommodations, medical care and continuity  of care.<br />
Medical  Value Travel (MVT) describes the unique service of providing international  patients a world class resource for quality safe medical services at accredited  private acute care hospitals managed by U.S. based company for a single,  affordable price. International Hospital Corporation has recently created a  Medical Value Travel Department in all of their Latin American Hospitals. The  MVT Department will provide international patient services focusing on  patient-centric services.</p>
    <p>International  Hospital Corporation is a Texas company that owns and operates high-quality  healthcare facilities throughout Latin America. With a U.S. based management  team and assets in Mexico, Costa Rica and Brazil, IHC is uniquely positioned as  the sole Pan-American leader in hospital based healthcare.<br />
IHC manages  eleven acute-care private hospitals: eight operating hospitals and hree  hospitals under development. Each hospital is modeled after state-of-the-art  facilities in the United States, providing a full range of basic and  sophisticated surgical, emergency and diagnostic services.<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Vision</strong><br />
Be the most  trusted and best source of high quality hospital services internationally<strong> </strong><br />
&nbsp;<strong>Mission</strong><br />
Be  internationally recognized for best practices and clinical and service  excellence by continuously improving processes and satisfying the needs of  those we serve<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Values</strong><br />
Quality  Sustainability Ethics<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Nearly a  dozen years ago our hospitals began with the sole purpose of providing the  highest quality healthcare to Latin America. Our hospitals are modeled after  high-quality facilities operating in the United States and are held accountable  by our management to U.S. quality care standards. <br />
Today, we  are the largest Pan-American Health System and we continue to be committed to  being the safest hospital system in the international market.<br />

    <td height="604"><p>This is my  first experience as a medical traveler. The whole time - planning, traveling,  treatment - I Have thought &ldquo;this is too good to be true.&rdquo; But I cannot dispute  the facts: My LSH was high tech, perfectly executed, no complications. The  price amazing. Everyone treated me with kindness and gentleness, even when I  was nervous and scared. I hope I never need them again (but having female  organs is like owning a dog who chases cars), because surgery is not fun, but  if I did, I would return<br />
      Doctors  Mojarra and Orozco performed a type of surgery (LSH) that no doctor where I  live can do. Dr. Mojarra is so skilled he even closed 2 of my tiny incisions  from the inside! After surgery, these doctors checked on me with a frequency  unheard of in the U.S.<br />
      This  success story would not have been possible without my nurse/interpreter  Lorenza. I came to Hermosillo by myself and I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish, so her  efforts were vital. She navigated me through every obstacle, large and small.  She spent hours and hours helping me and I am so grateful.<br />
  <strong>- Joyce B, California</strong></p>
      <p>Excellent  care, very clean. Everyone very friendly. Dr. Wolberg excellent. He knew my case  and history. I would contact Dr. Wolberg for all my future surgeries.<br />
        <strong>- Sharon D, Missouri</strong></p>
      <p>I was very  nervous about the procedure especially being performed in a foreign country. My  fears soon vanished when, at the airport I was met by an English speaking  representative of CIMA hospital. She was with me through every procedure,  checking process and even during the surgery. But it was perhaps the post  surgery care that was most impressive.<br />
        Angela Lara  was especially helpful, like having a personal representative in Costa Rica.  Nurse Isabella was very kind and knowledgeable. Dr. Ariel Rivera was kind and  answered my every question.<br />
        I was  treated like a celebrity. I recommend CIMA Hospital without reservation. It was  a wonderful experience. All staff was considerate, courteous and even though  there was a language barrier, they all tried to understand and attend to my  needs.<br />
  <strong>- Brandy L, Texas</strong></p>
      <p>I felt very  well taken care of. Angela, the coordinator was excellent, made herself  available and guided me through the whole process. This was important  especially because everything is new and unknown and because I don&rsquo;t speak  Spanish.<br />
  &nbsp;The procedure went very well and the recovery  process was easy. I was very happy with the results and the skills and  knowledge of the doctor. The facility and staff at Hospital CIMA San Jose are  of high quality &ndash; Everything was very satisfactory.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        Dr. Suarez  was excellent and met with me the day before the procedure, answered all my  questions - I felt very reassured.<br />
