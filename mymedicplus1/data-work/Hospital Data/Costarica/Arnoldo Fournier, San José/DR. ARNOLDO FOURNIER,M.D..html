	<p align="center"><strong><u>Facelift</u></strong><br />
	  <strong>For a younger and fresher look</strong><br />
	  A facelift,  also called &quot;rhytidectomy&quot; improves the overall appearance of the  face for both men and women, by tightening underlying muscles in the face,  removing excess fat accumulated over the years and gently tightening the skin  of the face and neck. In many cases, a facelift procedure is done in  conjunction with other cosmetic procedures such as eyelid surgery necessary  when there are bags or pouches around the eyes.<br />
	  Folds or  wrinkles may appear between the mouth and nose, loose skin and extra fat (hanging  jowls) may be visible near the jaw, cheekbones may no longer look as prominent  because of sagging. Excess skin or fat on the neck could also be a problem.  Facelift corrects all of these aging signs in a natural-looking way while  preserving the natural characteristics of the person.<br />
	  An incision  is made along the hairline from the temple down around the ear lobe and to the  back of the neck. A small incision may also be made under the chin to remove  excess fat. After separating the skin from the muscle and fat underneath  Platysma muscles in the neck are cut, then pulled to sides below ears up back  and to the center under the chin. The excess of skin is removed. So, sagging  muscles and tissues can be tightened and fat deposits removed.<br />
	  The  incisions are closed along natural skin lines and creases, and scars are fine  and almost undetectable. Usually they fade and gradually become barely  noticeable. Most of the scars are in the hairline or behind the ears. The fine  scars at the front of the ears can be easily hidden with makeup if necessary.</p>
    <p>The average  facelift today lasts from five to ten years depending on the patient&yen;s age and  health conditions. Follow-up procedures can be performed when needed.</p>
    <p><strong>Facelift restores the youthful look  to the face.</strong><br />
      Length of procedure:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  2-5 hours<br />
      Type of  anesthesia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Local anesthesia and  sedation<br />
      Hospital  staying:&nbsp;&nbsp;  6-8 hours<br />
      Post-operatory  stay in Costa Rica:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  14 days</p>
