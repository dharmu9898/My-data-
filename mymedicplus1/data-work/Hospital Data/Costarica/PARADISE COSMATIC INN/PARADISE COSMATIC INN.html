    <td><p><strong>Hi Raul!</strong><br />
      I just want  to thank you and your staff for an enjoyable trip to<br />
      Costa Rica.  You guys took great care of me and I will never forget it.<br />
  <strong>Chris Arcadipane</strong><br />
      11/24/08</p>
      <p>&nbsp;<strong>Hi  Raul!</strong><br />
        I was very  comfy at the inn last time. Maybe i will hurt less because the surgeries will  be somewhat less involved. What i liked was that when Julia observed i was not  esting well because the hamburger had too much garlic in it, she had soup made  for me pollo with less cilantro. I liked that she cared and extended herself  for my comfort. I like spice but only as a subtle taste enhancement.<br />
        Your nurses  were so sweet. The night nurses were so kind and make sure i was comfortable. I  will not entry to take over my own care this next time. I did not do so well  because i could not reach and area as well as they could. The inn is so very  clean, warm and smelled so good. The showers were warm and the flat screen  satellite tv helped me get trough room. It was warmer and less breezy.<br />
        Since i  will be wearing more like housecoats/robes, i am not going anywhere again. With  drains, one is so limited anyway... I loved the handy computer and little  canaries!!<br />
        It will  feel like i am coming home in a way<br />
        Warmest  wishes, <br />

      <p>Hello  Everyone!<br />
        Sorry it  has taken me so long to return this message.&nbsp;  My experience was very good.&nbsp; Dr.  Quesada was a dream!&nbsp; He madeall the&nbsp; difference. Everything went smooth and was  very professional.&nbsp; The&nbsp; hospital was beautiful and communication was  not a problem. The Paradise Cosmetic Inn was fantastic.&nbsp; EVERYONE there was so nice and bent over  backwards for everyone.&nbsp; The rooms were  lovely and comfortable and the food was out of this world.&nbsp; I just can't say enough&nbsp; nice things about them. I've been losing  weight and taking my vitamins and everything is going good. Thanks again for  all your help.&nbsp; I'd have never had the  courage&nbsp; to do this if it wasn't for you  and all the information your staff provided.&nbsp;  I hope Dr. Quesada realizes how valuable you are! </p>
      <p>Thanks, <br />
        <strong>ELLEN</strong></p>
      <p>Rose, Raul,  et'al, <br />
        Made it  home safe and sound! PCI is embedded in my memories and my heart, you were all  wonderful, caring, hospitable, and incredibly&nbsp;  accommodating. From the moment I stepped off and back on the plane in  San Jose you&nbsp; were there, I never felt  alone!<br />
        I cant  thank you enough and look forward to my return.<br />
        Warm  Regards,<br />

      <p>Greetings  to all the wonderful staff at Paradise Cosmetic Inn,Where do I start? Rick and  I want to thank you all so very much for the excellent care &amp; wonderful  food (Raoul, I'm still waiting for the soup recipe!).<br />
        Never have  I seen a staffas competent and caring as the staff at Paradise. Melissa, the  Massage Therapist, gave by far the best massages ever and Elizabeth's mealswere  delicious, especially the fresh, homemade soups and the wonderful fruits and  vegetables that were always available. We were never underfed that's for  sure.The grounds were beautiful, and the view was magnificent. I especially  enjoyed my hours reading onthe outdoor couches and being able to look down at  San Jose and the different<br />
        mountains.  Rick and I both had some wonderful experiences and we owe our fast recovery in  a big part to the wonderful staff. We're both recovering nicely, and are well  pleased with the results of our work. Please give our regards to everyone.Thank  you again from the bottom of our hearts and we'll be seeing you again.<br />
  <strong>MARY AND RICK</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We are able  to obtain the perfect smile that We always wanted and of course we did some  other little thinks that we are not telling, but everything is so good and  incredibly inexpensive that we could not resist. We will be back soon for more!  We also has great time while we were there.</p>
