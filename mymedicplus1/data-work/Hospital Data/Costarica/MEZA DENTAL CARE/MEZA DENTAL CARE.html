    <td><p><strong>Satisfied Patient Testimonials</strong><br />
  &nbsp;Having traveled to dozens of countries and  gotten dental care in several of them, I was incredibly impressed by the  talent, safety and warmth of the team at Meza Dental.<br />
      In many  aspects, my experience at Meza surpassed any that I have had before. From the  first moment when you meet Jose, who will pick you up at your hotel to take you  to the clinic personally, you know that this trip to the dentist is going to be  special. </p>
      <p>I have  never felt so at home or welcome in a medical setting. I now have a new smile,  which I use whenever I get to tell my friends about where I went for dental  care. <br />
        Thank you.<br />

      <p>I have been  a practicing dentist since 1978.<br />
        I found the  Meza Dental Clinic to be equal and superior to the finest dental offices I have  visited throughout the world. It is very comforting to be in a facility where  the dentist/owner as well as the staff has a professional, warm and caring  relationship with you that you feel immediately. <br />
        One is  equally impressed by the efficiency reflected by the technology available in  the office. The decorum lends itself to comfortability while waiting as well as  when you begin to receive the service. <br />
        Dr. Meza&rsquo;s treatment  plans and clinical skills are second to none. My wife and I received the finest  quality dental care possible at the Meza Dental Clinic, and would personally  recommend them to anyone. Additionally, the savings we realized were enough to  pay for our very nice vacation in the beautiful Costa Rica. <br />
        Respectfully, <br />
  <strong>HAROLD A. MCADOO DDS </strong><br />
        RETIRED  DENTIST <br />
        COL/U.S.  ARMY <br />

      <p>If you are  thinking about traveling to Costa Rica for dental work, I am pleased to share  my recent experience with Meza Dental Care and to offer my enthusiastic  recommendation for Dr. Meza and his team. <br />
        My husband  and I recently returned to Virginia after visiting Costa Rica for dental work,  and then a wonderful vacation afterward. We had the pleasure of being well  cared for by Meza Dental Care. Overall, this turned out to be a very good  decision for us, as well as a positive experience. We were able to save  approximately 10K on dental work from the estimate given by my dentist up here,  including implants, root canals, fillings, crowns and cosmetic work needed  between the two of us. Moreover, we were able to restore decades of neglect in  one week, all with excellent results!<br />
        My  experience with this practice exceeded my expectations in every respect. As to the  quality of the treatment, I would be delighted to be a regular patient if Dr.  Meza&rsquo;s office was here in Virginia. Honestly, Dr. Meza and his associates are  the caliber of professionals that would have a waiting list for new patients in  some places. I was particularly impressed with the attention and consideration  given to my comfort and tolerances by both the professionals and staff. (It was  a grueling week of back to back dentist appointments, after all.) I had never  had a dental assistant offer me either a blanket or neck pillow before at my  dentist here.<br />
        The  logistics are also well attended to by the clinic. You are treated as invited  guest immediately upon arrival at the airport - literally. The clinic provides  transportation to and from your hotel and the office for all of your  appointments. The transportation is really a nice feature that eliminates all  the hassle of getting around for the appointments, and Jose, the driver, is an  excellent resource and a truly pleasant and helpful guy. <br />
        In the waiting  area I met several people from all over the United States: Florida,  Connecticut, Missouri, Oregon, Washington State - and us from Virginia. Without  a single exception, every one of Dr. Meza&rsquo;s patients had all the same positive  things to say about their experience. <br />
        Bottom  line: My husband and I got 18K worth of dental work, which would have taken  months of appointments at home, all completed in one week for around 8K. (Ask  me if I smiled when I wrote that!) Our entire experience with Meza Dental Care  was first class, and I am happy to recommend these professionals to anyone  without hesitation. Feel free to contact me by email if you would like  additional information. <br />
