	  <p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p>
	  <p>I had an abdominoplasty in Costa Rica seven months ago by a Plastic Surgeon, Dr. Gabriel Peralta, which was a superb experience.</p>
	  <p>Dr. Peralta sat with for an hour and a half explaining the difference between a liposuction, an abdominoplasty and the possible outcome on each procedure.&nbsp;He was in no hurry, he took his time to respond to all my questions, even went further to show me pictures of previous patients and open up a file with all my personal information, all the drawings and his suggestions to which one was more appropriate for me.&nbsp;He was the fourth doctor that I visited regarding this procedure and the only who took the time to explain it and clarify the pros and cons on it.</p>
	  <p>I contacted Dr. Peralta two months later to discuss further inquires and to schedule an appointment for surgery on September 19, 2006.&nbsp;He requested several medical tests before the surgery for medical clearance.</p>
	  <p>The day before the surgery, I went to his clinic for the final details.&nbsp;He took &ldquo;the before&rdquo; pictures, measured me and marked all the points where the incision would be done, also gave me instructions to follow the night before the surgery.</p>
	  <p>The following morning at 6 a.m. Mrs. Amelia, the sweetest and most special nurse I had ever met, took me to my room, helped me undress and got me ready for surgery, she stood by my side and whole time.&nbsp;When I woke from the surgery I was in recuperation where Dr. Peralta and the nurse were adjusting the girdle that I had to wear.</p>
	  <p>Approximately 6 lbs. of skin and fat were removed from my stomach, also got rid of my appendix scar and made me a perfect belly button.&nbsp;Everything went so smooth that I did not feel any pain or discomfort.&nbsp;Ms. Meli took me to my room, helped me to dress and got me ready to go home.</p>
	  <p>The following two and a half weeks Dr. Peralta and his staff were in contact with me on a daily basis.&nbsp;Dr. Peralta requested that I visit the clinic almost every other day to check the incision, to clean my drainage and to make sure the skin was healing properly.&nbsp;He also gave me prescriptions for pain killers; antibiotics and a girdle that I had to wear for support.&nbsp;A week later he took my drainage out and the stitches were removed the following week.&nbsp;I went back for a final check up and &ldquo;the after&rdquo; pictures on October 12th.&nbsp;My recuperation at home was very easy and my scar healed perfectly and quickly.</p>
	  <p>Dr. Peralta and his staff me my expectations at every level.&nbsp;His professionalism and caring from beginning to end was excellent. He made me feel very secure and relaxed at all times.&nbsp;The staff at the Clinic took care of all the spoiling and caring; there was no day that I did not receive attention from them.&nbsp;It is been 7 months and my scar is almost gone, I have a flat tummy with hardly any scars and I look awesome.</p>
	  <p>Thank you Dr. Peralta.</p>
