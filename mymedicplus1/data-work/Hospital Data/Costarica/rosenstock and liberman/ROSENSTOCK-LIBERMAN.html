	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Hair 
	Transplant Surgery<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	process of losing hair is a natural occurrence. We normally lose about 
	40-200 hairs daily. Our hair starts to thin out when the lost hairs out 
	number the regrowth of the follicles. There are multiple causes of hair 
	loss, the most important being hereditary (genetic). This means that every 
	hair follicle has its life course predicted from the time we are in the 
	womb. Other causes are hormonal, stress, scarring after scalp trauma, bad 
	nutrition and medications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Male 
	pattern baldness starts at different ages and areas of our head, most 
	commonly in the crown and/or temples and frontal hair line. A female's hair 
	loss is more of a generalized thinning of the hair affecting the whole 
	scalp.All persons are possible candidates for hair restoration. The one 
	important factor is the donor area, Occipital (back) and temporal areas 
	(sides) of each candidate. The reason why the hair is taken from the 
	Occipital or temporal areas of the scalp is that these hairs will not fall 
	in our lifetime. If you see persons in their eighties or nineties, they 
	usually have hair in the occipital and temporal areas. It is very rare to 
	see complete baldness unless there is some type of medication or illness 
	behind it.Transplanted hair is for life. We have been doing hair transplants 
	for 25 years and have gone through the evolution form large (3-3.5 
	millimeters) plugs (7-10 hairs per grafts) to the present mini (3-4 hairs) 
	and micrografts (1-2 hairs), (1-1.75 millimeters). Presently we place 
	several hundred to over a thousand grafts per session. Our vast experience 
	and the usage of mini and micrografts provides each patient with a natural 
	look, which is the most important aspect of this procedure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">THE 
	PROCEDURE</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Hair 
	transplants are done in our surgical suites as an out-patient procedure with 
	local anesthesia. The session takes an average of 2-4 hours depending on the 
	number of grafts used.The first consultation involves a complete history of 
	the medical and hair condition of the patient. Each patient is evaluated in 
	a unique way. All aspects of his/her hair are evaluated: donor area, 
	recipient area, combing styles, how many grafts and/or sessions are needed 
	to achieve each patient's goals.What is transplanted is the follicle, which 
	is from where the hair grows; this is inside the skin of our scalp. It is 
	the follicle that has the genetic information of not to fall. We could 
	transplant this follicle to any place in the same patient's body and it will 
	grow.The procedure involves harvesting the grafts from the donor area (strip 
	of hair) and placing them were they are needed (frontal hairline, crown 
	area). <o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	donor area is washed, outline and trimmed. Next the local anesthesia is 
	applied and the grafts are harvested. After harvesting, the donor area is 
	sutured. The donor area is invisible since it is covered by your hair; and 
	the suture line is very thin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	next step is the cleaning and preparing of the mini-micro grafts for 
	insertion into the recipient sites. The recipient area is anesthetized and 
	then the grafts are placed in the normal direction that hair grows. <o:p></o:p>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">After 
	the grafts are inserted a bandage is placed over the scalp. This dressing is 
	removed on the morning after the procedure. The dressing is to keep the area 
	clean and all the grafts in place for a few hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	POSTOPERATORY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	patient is seen in our center the day after the procedure to remove the 
	dressing and have a shampoo. After combing their hair they are ready to go 
	home or work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	first 6-7 days after the procedure the patients are asked to restrain from 
	strenuous physical activities (jogging, playing sports ), they are not 
	allowed to go to swimming pools or the ocean for 15 days. He/she can start 
	to do all his/her desk work, or light activity the second day. On the 8th 
	postoperative day the sutures are removed. A scab will form over each 
	transplanted graft. All the scabs will fall off by themselves around the 
	10th postoperative day.Transplanted hair starts to grow around the second 
	month after the procedure at 1 centimeter per month for the rest of the 
	patient's life. Once the hair starts to grow it can be treated as your 
	normal hair; cut, wash, and comb it. This is for life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Facelift<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">As 
	people age, the effects of gravity, exposure to the sun, and stresses of 
	daily life can be seen in their faces. Deep creases form between the nose 
	and mouth; the jawline grows slack and jowly; folds and fat deposits appear 
	aroud the neck. These changes occur at different rates in different people, 
	and are unavoidable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Not 
	long ago, a facelift was considered by many to be reserved for movie stars 
	and celebrities. Today, a facelift, or rhytidectomy, is not just for the 
	rich and famous. It is one of the most well-accepted and most frequently 
	performed cosmetic procedures in the world. Early facelift operations 
	tightened only the skin, placing all the tension on the suture line. This 
	stress frequently widened the scars, making them and, indeed, the facelift 
	operation very obvious. Since the skin has an amazing capacity for 
	expansion, results were not only less than optimal, they were also short 
	lived and many times with the appearance of an overdone mask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">With a 
	better understanding of anatomy, the tension in a facelift operation has 
	been transferred to the deeper anatomical layers. Therefore, no excessive 
	tension is applied to the skin leaving the natural beauty of the individual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Today 
	the main goal of a facelift procedure is to give a younger and fresher look 
	preserving the natural characteristics of the patient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Additional procedures, such as submental liposuction, forehead lifting, 
	eyelid surgery, or fat transfer can be performed at the same time to effect 
	a more complete facial rejuvenation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">THE 
	PROCEDURE<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	operation is performed by making incisions within the hairline above and 
	behind the ear, and in the natural creases area just in front of the ear. By 
	making the incisions in this locations, healing occurs with virtually 
	undetectable scars. The skin is lifted outward and the underlying muscles 
	and tissues are redraped and tightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Excess 
	skin is removed, and if required excess fat is aspirated from the neck and 
	jawline areas to define these areas better. The skin is sutured without 
	tension, to ensure the finest scars possible that would lead to a virtually 
	undetectable scar.The operation is done under local anesthesia andsedation. 
	In most of the cases you'll spend the night at our center, being discharged 
	the following day with professional nursing care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	POSTOPERATORY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	bandage is removed the following day and patients are then allowed to shower 
	and wash the hair. Then another bandage is applied for 24hrs more to 
	minimize swelling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Patients usually feel and look okay surprisingly quickly after a facelift. 
	There is usually very little pain. Bruises are usually gone by the end of 
	the first week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Although most of swelling disappears within the first two weeks, final 
	results are seen at about 3 months after the surgery. Most people are able 
	to return to their job by the second week with the help of camouflage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">If you 
	are coming from abroad we advise you to stay for 8-10 days in our country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Blepharoplasty (eye surgery)<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	eyes, commonly referred to as the windows of the soul, say a great deal 
	about a person. We evaluate people's moods or attitudes by the light in 
	their eyes or its absence. The loose skin over your eyes and the fat bags 
	under them make you look more tired and older than you feel inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Contrary to the perception that you have to be a certain age before you need 
	to have your eyes done, young adults may also benefit from removing bags 
	under the eyes or lifting heavy lids. The average person as early as age 25 
	may have enough laxity in the upper eyelid that they can obtain significant 
	improvement and at age approximately 25-30 for the lower eyelid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Operations on the eyelids are not only among the most commonly performed 
	plastic surgery procedures but also the ones that give you a high degree of 
	improvement, and satisfaction. It may be performed alone or in conjunction 
	with other facial surgery procedures such as a facelift or a brow lift.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">THE 
	PROCEDURE<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	goal of eyelid surgery is to rejuvenate the face by restoring the shape of 
	the eye. Blepharoplasty is usually performed under local anesthesia and 
	sedation. Fine incisions are placed in the crease above each eye to correct 
	problems of the upper eyelids. Then a thin crescent of excess skin and 
	muscle is removed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Excess 
	fatty tissue from the middle most portion of the eyelid is also removed. 
	Sometimes there is also excess fatty tissue at the region over the eyebrow 
	that can be removed in the same procedure. The incisions are closed with 
	very fine sutures. The lower eyelid has two surgical approaches. The one we 
	use the most is through a transconjuntival approach which is an incision 
	where the scar is hidden inside the eyelid and is performed in patients that 
	have only excess fatty tissue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">When 
	excess skin and muscle needs to be removed, there is an incision placed in 
	the natural simple crease below the lash line . Skin and muscle are 
	repositioned and excess skin is removed. Neither incision requires any 
	contact with the eyeball itself. When the surgery is finished a lubricating 
	ointment is frequently placed on the eyeball. The whole procedure takes 
	usually between one and a half to two hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	POSTOPERATORY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">During 
	the first 24 hours , cold compresses are applied to the eyelids to reduce 
	swelling and bruising. This surgery is done as an outpatient procedure, so 
	if the operation is performed in the morning, you will be discharged in the 
	afternoon after resting in your suite and feel comfortable to go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">This 
	is as close to pain free plastic surgery as you can get. You may be given 
	prescription pain medication, but it is unlikely that you would need to use 
	it for more than a day, if at all. Sutures are removed usually at 48-72 
	hours. You will be allowed to return to work in three to four days, but most 
	people would wait a week to allow bruising to resolve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Rhinoplasty (nose surgery)<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	nose is one of the most dominant and distinctive features of the human body. 
	Its central location only serves to confirm its importance. However, when it 
	is the center of attention as well, you can be relatively certain that 
	something is out of balance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	cosmetic procedure of recontouring the nose is one of the most popular 
	procedures sought by plastic surgery patients today. Reasons for such 
	requests range from recontouring or reshaping the external nose, to 
	straightening a previously injured nose and/or improving the patient's 
	ability to breathe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	ideal nose varies from face to face depending on skin type, ethnic 
	background, age, and other variables. The most important matter sought today 
	by plastic surgeons is to provide a natural looking nose that goes 
	accordingly to the patient's own facial appearance. The patient may elect 
	also to have chin or cheek implants at the same time to enhance and balance 
	their facial features.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">THE 
	PROCEDURE<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Most 
	of the incisions for reducing or recontouring the external nose are made 
	inside the nose. Occasionally a small external incision is necessary, 
	depending on the complexity of the problem. The nasal skin is lifted away 
	from the cartilage and bone and excess tissue is removed. Then the 
	cartilages at the tip of the nose are sculpted to refine the nasal tip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Sometimes instead of resecting tissues, it is necessary to place grafts that 
	may have been harvested from the patient's own septum or ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	procedure is sometimes combined with septum surgery to correct deviations of

	Necklifts are usually performed under local anesthesia and sedation. The

	<p class="MsoNormal">

	0,3 inches incisions are placed behind the crease of the ears and 
	liposuction is carried out with fine non traumatic canulas. Following this a 
	small incision is placed in the small crease hidden under the chin in order 
	to complete the liposuction and treat the platysma muscle underneath, so it 
	is repositioned and tightened with sutures.If there is an excess of skin it 
	is removed at that time. The incisions are then close and a light 
	stockinette-type dressing is applied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	they start loosing weight the skin under there arms starts to sag. This 
	sagging skin gets in the way of everyday life; it is not aesthetically

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Procedure: The only way to get rid of this excess skin is by removing it 
	surgically. The procedure most of the time is done with local anesthesia and 
	sedation and it&#8217;s performed as an out patient procedure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">First 
	a liposuction is done to remove any excess adipose tissue and then an 
	incision is made from the inner aspect of the elbow to the axilla. Then we 
	undermine the excess skin and remove it. All sutures placed are 
	reabsorbable, in other words no suture removal is needed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Recovery: The procedure will not incapacitate you; you need to take it easy 
	with arm movements for two weeks. No drains are used. You can expect some 
	swelling and black and blue for a couple of days and minor discomfort. We 
	prescribe analgesic and antibiotics. You will use a garment; for 2-3 weeks, 
	which we provide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Breast 
	enhancement or augmentation is one of the most frequently performed cosmetic 
	surgeries in the world. It is the procedure of choice for women who consider 
	their breasts to be too small or have undergone a process of weight loss, 
	childbirth's or just normal aging, in which the breasts have lost volume and 
	their shape has changed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	surgery consists of lifting the breast tissue and placing silicone rubber 
	implants, which are then filled in most of the cases with a saline solution. 
	Depending on the desire of the patient, silicone gel implants can be used 
	safely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">One 
	very important matter to take in account is that after several large studies 
	conducted worldwide, it has been clearly demonstrated that there is no 
	scientific evidence that breast augmentation increases the risk of cancer. 
	Breast augmentation will make your breasts fuller and enhance their shape. 
	Often patients start to feel more comfortable finding easier to wear certain 
	styles of clothing providing them a more proportional figure .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	the most frequently incision employed is around the lower half of the areola 
	which results in an inconspicuous, almost invisible scar. Then, a pocket is 
	created behind the breast tissue, where the implant is positioned. Sutures 
	are placed to close the incisions, and a gauze bandage and supporting bra

	have the surgery done and are discharged the same day after resting in your 
	own suite and feel comfortable to go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	procedure takes about two to two and a half hours to be performed, depending 
	on each case. Most women after the surgery experience some degree of 
	swelling, bruising and tenderness, but these symptoms subside in a short 
	time and can be controlled with oral medications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">You 
	should wear the surgical bra for about four to five weeks. People are 
	usually able to return to their desk jobs within the first week, although 
	most wait a full week to ten days to do so. Having a breast augmentation 
	procedure can drastically improve the way a woman sees herself giving a 
	boost to own self-esteem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Breast

	of problems, from back and neck pain and irritated skin to skeletal 
	deformities and breathing difficulties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">These 
	patients often complain of painful grooves in their shoulders produced by 
	their breasts. In these cases the ideal procedure is a reduction mammaplasty 
	in which the surgeon will not only reduce the size of the breast, but will 
	sculpt it to give the best possible shape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In 
	some patients the problem is mostly stretched skin with looseness of the 
	whole breast in which the problem is confined to the shape and form of the 
	breast. In these cases a breast lift is the ideal procedure and the surgeon 
	will create a better shaped breast without necessary reducing the size of 
	the breast. In fact sometimes these procedure is performed in conjunction 
	with breast augmentation, depending on the size of the breast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Of all

	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Depending on the size of the breast there are several variations of 
	techniques employed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	most common technique employed is the classic Pitanguy technique which is 
	used for larger and/or very flaccid breasts. In these cases incisions are 
	placed circling the areola, extending downward, and following the natural 
	curve of the crease beneath the breasts. The areola is reduced in diameter 
	if needed and excess glandular tissue, fat and skin are removed. 
	Subsequently the areola is placed in the new higher position even with the 
	inframmamary crease or a little higher. The remaining tissues are reshaped 
	around the areola to achieve the desired contour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">For 
	cases in which there is no, or little excess mammary tissue, a variation of 
	the Pitanguy technique may be employed. In this case the incisions are 
	placed surrounding the areola extending downward onto the natural crease of 
	the breast without an horizontal extension. A pedicle or tissue base is 
	created from the lower pole of the breast and it is transferred to the upper 
	pole, so the breast adopts an harmonic conical shape. Then the incisions are 
	sutured and a dressing is applied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">One of 
	the most important questions in regard to the technique employed is your 
	goals and expectations of the surgery. Items like size and shape of the 
	breast will be fully discussed prior to your surgery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">These 
	procedures are usually carried out under general anesthesia, especially if 
	associated with other procedures. In certain cases of breast lift local 
	anesthesia and sedation may be utilized. You may feel some discomfort during 
	the first couple of days, but will easily be controlled by the use of 
	analgesics.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">For 
	the first few days following breast surgery, you will wear surgical 
	dressings and a special post-surgical bra is worn for several weeks. You 
	should avoid lifting your arms or pushing anything heavy for the first three 
	to four weeks. With the support of your surgical bra, you should be able to 
	increase your activity level at a steady pace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">You

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">From 
	the greek words for &quot;womanlike&quot; breasts, gynecomastia is a condition 
	affecting an estimated 40 to 60 percent of men. Because men have such small 
	amounts of breast tissue, most of us rarely give a man's breasts a thought

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Breasts, female or male, are primarily composed of fat and glandular tissue, 
	the development of which is governed by hormones. Excessive breast 
	development can be psychologically debilitating at any age, but especially 
	in the teen years, when body image is so important to one's identity. 
	Gynecomastia may be the reason behind difficulty at school and antisocial

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">When

	liposuction, is the procedure of choice. The technique used is similar to 
	the one described for liposuction in general, and the liposuction is carried 
	out inserting a canula through a small incision at the bottom of the areola. 
	This technique gives excellent results on this specific deformity. <o:p></o:p>
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In the 
	infrequent instances where the breast is composed largely of glandular 
	tissue, direct excision is combined with the liposuction technique. Dense 
	glandular tissue is not aspirated as easily as fat through a suction canula 
	and needs to be removed using a 2-3 inch incision, which is located usually 
	under the areola.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	swelling, unevenness or waviness. Your results will be likely visible almost

	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Today 
	dermato lipectomy is a procedure usually considered secondary or ancillary 
	to liposuction. Liposuction alone causes skin contraction, which may correct 
	the entire problem or will, at least reduce the extent of any subsequent 
	skin resection. Even though liposuction is the current body contouring 
	procedure of choice, derma lipectomy still has its place, especially when 
	there is too much skin to respond favorably to liposuction alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	most obvious area to benefit from this type of operation is the abdomen of 
	patients who have lost large amounts of weight (fifty pounds or more). The 
	best candidate for this surgery is a person with relatively normal weight, 
	weak muscles and excess skin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">A 
	Tummy Tuck or abdominoplasty is a surgical procedure designed to flatten a

	skin. Then the abdomen muscles which were flacid are pulled together and 
	tightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The

	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Abdominoplasty is usually carried either under general anesthesia or spinal 
	anesthesia, although in some cases local anesthesia and sedation may be 
	used. The procedure takes about three hours to be performed, and then you 
	will be transferred into your own private suite, where our professional 
	staff will assist you in all of your needs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In 
	abdominoplasty a one night stay is recommended, especially if associated 
	with other procedures, although in selected cases the procedure may be 
	carried out as an outpatient procedure, depending on the extent of the 
	surgery and preoperatory conditions of the patient. For the first few days 
	your abdomen will be swollen and you're likely to feel some discomfort, 
	which can easily be controlled with medication.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Physical activity will be limited somehow after the surgery, but with the 
	support garment, you are going to be able to increase your activity at a 
	steady pace. You'll be feeling better with each day passing. We encourage 
	our patients to begin walking as soon as possible although you must refrain 
	from any stenous activity or lifting .<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">One 
	important matter is that scars, usually fade over time and are placed in 
	areas where they will be easily hidden by underwear. Sutures are removed in 
	between 7-10 days and most patients are able to return to their desk jobs 
	after that. Patients who understand well this surgery are usually very 
	satisfied because results are quite dramatic giving them a slimmer, trimmer 
	figure, with a flatter abdomen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	Liposuction<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	number of fat cells in the body are established by the time a person reaches 
	puberty. After these period these cells act like balloons, so when we gain 
	weight these cells augment their size, because they're storing more fat. 
	Also when we loose weight these cells tend to &quot;shrink&quot; because the fat 
	inside diminishes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">What 
	these means is that after puberty these cells stay the same in number, but 
	may get larger and smaller depending on several factors varying from person 
	to person. Liposuction is a procedure that can help sculpt the body by 
	removing these unwanted cells of fat from different areas of the body. When 
	removed these cells will never come back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Liposuction today is the most commonly requested cosmetic surgery in the

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Liposuction is also used to correct enlarged male breasts, a condition known

	virtually any other plastic surgery procedure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In 
	liposuction the area to be treated is injected with a special 
	fluid/anesthesia combination prior to suctioning. The fluid constricts the 
	surrounding blood vessels, making the procedure nearly bloodless, while 
	minimizing the pain. It also provides anesthesia during and after surgery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">When 
	the procedure is to be started a thin, hollow tube, or cannula, is inserted 
	through one or more tiny incisions near the designated area. It is attached 
	to a machine that creates a strong vacuum. The cannula is strategically 
	manipulated to contour and sculpt the body. No actual pain is felt during 
	the procedure, although you may feel an occasional stinging sensation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Multiple areas of the body may be treated at the same time. Depending on the 
	areas to be treated liposuction can take from one to two and a half hours. 
	After the procedure is finished fine sutures are placed in the incisions, 
	and tight fitting garments are worn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	cases, so you will be discharged after resting in your suite and feel 
	comfortable to go. You may feel a little bruised and sore as if you would 
	have overexercised that part of the body. Some swelling is expected, which 
	commonly peaks at three to four days and disappears within four to six 
	weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Depending on the areas treated you may return to work the next day although 
	some patients wait two to three days of rest to return to their work. It is

	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">After 
	losing significant weight the skin on inner thigh starts to sag. The excess 
	skin and adipose tissue are not aesthetically pleasing. The cosmetic 
	appearance, the physical problems like skin discoloration, chaffing, 
	difficulty in walking all come to play an important part after the weight 
	loss. Most persons do not like to been seen wearing shorts because of the 
	excess flaccidity of the skin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Candidates: Any person that has loose skin in the inner thigh and or 
	excessive adipose tissue is a candidate for this type of procedure. It is 
	well know that rubbing between the legs causes itching, hyper pigmentation 
	and even fungus infections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Procedure: Most of the time is it done under local anesthesia. First 
	liposuction is performed, then an incision is made in the inguinal fold; the 
	skin is separated from the underlying tissues and the excess skin is 
	removed. The skin with its underlying tissue is sutured in three layers. No 
	suture removal is required; they will reabsorb. No drains are used. A thigh 
	lift procedure can be combined with other procedures like Arm lift, 
	facelift, breast surgery and tummy tuck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Postoperative Care: The incision will be covered with sterile gauze and then 
	a panty type garment will be provided. The garment will be used for 2-3 
	weeks. Since the inguinal area is a very humid area and it is always in 
	movement we really have to take care of the incision; no excessive walking 
	for one week; no jogging for 2 weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Results: You are going to be able to use shorts and the incision will be 
	hidden in the inguinal fold. Your legs will feel less tired because of less 
	skin sagging, which will provide an increase in your overall physical 
	activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Not 
	only has body contour surgery emerged and increased in numbers, but the age 
	spectrum for both male and female body contour surgery has also been greatly 
	expanded to include much younger patients on one end of the spectrum and 
	much older patients on the other. Lower body lift are performed usually in 
	patients that have undergone massive weight loss as a consequence of surgery 
	in which the &quot;tire&quot; of hanging skin and tissue is removed from around the 
	entire midbody. These patients usually present with large quantities of 
	abdominal fat and skin excess, a descended or hanging pubic area, back 
	rolls, flat and saggy buttocks, excessive laxity on the lateral thighs, and 
	no waist definition. Usually these patients will also require surgical 
	procedures on the face, arms, breasts, inner thighs, and back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	Surgical procedure<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">A 
	lower body lift usually requires between 6 to 8 hours of surgery. The 
	patient is marked on the standing position just before the surgery. The 
	excess skin is grasped at the level of the flanks with both hands trying to 
	join each other, putting an important amount of tension. The horizontal 
	lines of resection and the final incision placement are marked. These 
	incisions are continued both anteriorly from hip bone to hip bone and 
	posteriorly until they join with the markings of the contra lateral side. At 
	this time areas that need to be sculpted with liposuction are also marked. 
	These markings will guide us at the time of surgery and will make operative 
	times quicker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">This 
	surgery is carried out under general anesthesia and the patient is placed on 
	the operating bed on one side first and then on the other side. Incisions 
	are made following the previously marked lines. The removal of excess skin 
	and fat is performed at this time. There is a moderate undermining of the 
	tissues inferiorly. Once this is done, liposuction is performed at the level 
	of the upper lateral thigh, flanks, posterior trunk and/or other areas 
	previously chosen. Then, the incision is continued at the abdominal area 
	just above the pubic area, running from hipbone to hipbone and a second 
	incision is made around the navel to loosen it from the surrounding tissue. 
	After separating the skin from the abdominal wall up to the sternum and 
	ribs, the separated muscles (rectus abdominus) will be pulled together and 
	sutured from pubis to sternum. The apron of excess skin and fat in this area 
	is removed and the navel will be repositioned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The 
	tissues are approximated placing the highest-tension on the wound closure 
	laterally at the level of the flanks, and less medially. Two to Four drains 
	are placed alone the incision lines to evacuate any old blood and prevent 
	fluid accumulation. The incisions are sutured and a dressing is applied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
	POSTOPERATORY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">A one 
	to three night stay at our center is recommended. Expect to be sore for 
	about one week and require prescription medication. After one week any 
	residual discomfort is easily controlled with over-the-counter medications. 
	Sponge baths are mandatory until the drains are removed, which might be up 
	to a week after the procedure. You will continue to wear the support 
	garments night and day for approximately five weeks, and will be removed 
	only to shower. Strenuous body activity is not recommended for the first 4-6 
	weeks, although walking is encouraged starting on the day after the surgery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
	<span style="font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">An 
	iron supplement is recommended after the surgery for at least two months to 
	help replenish any blood lost during the operation and will help you regain 
	your preoperative energy levels at a faster pace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
