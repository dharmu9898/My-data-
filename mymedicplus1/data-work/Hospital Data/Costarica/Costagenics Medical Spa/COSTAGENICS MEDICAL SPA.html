            Dr. Chacon, his    staff and clinic were very reassuring, professional and compassionate. The    Dr. examined me carefully and explained fully every step of the various    procedures available to me. We carefully made my choices, he wouldn't do more    surgery than he felt was absolutely safe. I've had cosmetic surgery in the    States, and they hurry up to wake you and send you home to deal with whatever    pain you may have alone. Here, you stay overnight in their clinic    comfortably, and under the watchful eyes of a registered nurse and medical    doctor. Another RN was available for the days after and recovery.&nbsp;<br />
            It was wonderful! If and when I do further cosmetic surgery, this is the only    place I would have it done!! </td>
