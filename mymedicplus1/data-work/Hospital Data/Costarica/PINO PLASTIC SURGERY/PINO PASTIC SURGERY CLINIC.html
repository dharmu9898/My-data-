    <td><p><strong>A Reference Guide For Aesthetic  Plastic Surgery</strong><br />
      Nowadays,  plastic surgery has become very popular. Surgical procedures are safer, people  live longer, and youth is a symbol of activity and beauty. Improvements of  physical defects give a better self-image, and the world is oriented to a  younger appearance.<br />
  <strong>Why Plastic Surgery In Costa Rica?</strong><br />
      Costa Rica  has good prestige in the medical field. A great number of its specialists have  been trained in the United States and Europe. For many people in other  countries, prohibitive costs are the main barrier for plastic surgery. Medical  costs are considerably lower in Costa Rica than in countries like the United  States, Canada or Europe. Costa Rican democracy has the greatest stability in  Latin America. The country's friendly and peaceful atmosphere is ideal for post-operative  recovery.<br />
  <strong>About The Clinic</strong><br />
      Pino's  Plastic Surgery Clinic is located in San Jos&eacute;. It has the most modern equipment  and technology in plastic surgery. All its equipment was imported from the U.S.  in accordance with the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) requirements. Any  kind of plastic surgery can be performed in this clinic. Approximately 98% of  the surgery we perform are in our operating rooms at the clinic. About 1-2% of  our patients are admitted to a private hospital for their surgery, especially  when there is a question about their health, like heart diseases, diabetes,  coagulation disorders, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Pino's Philosophy</strong><br />
        The  following remarks concerning your expectations will establish a greater  understanding between us.<br />
        The aim of  Aesthetic surgery is to make you look as good as possible. It cannot do more  than that. If you are expecting a transforming miracle, you will unquestionably  be disappointed.<br />
        Surgical  results from aesthetic surgery depend on a number of determining factors. Which  include (but are not limited to) the physical condition of the skin, the  presence or absence of fat, the relative age of the skin, the number and types  of wrinkles present, the underlying bone structure, heredity and hormonal  influences. Another factor involved in the final result the healing process, is  not entirely within the control of either surgeon or patient.<br />
        Surgery  intended to improve sagging tissues, wrinkles or fat necessarily leaves scars.  Despite what you may have heard, all surgical scars are permanent and cannot be  erased. The plastic surgeon's job is to place the scars in natural lines or in  places where they are least notice-able and more easily camouflaged by make-up.<br />
        Plastic  surgery is a combination of art and science but no surgery is an exact science.  It is not possible to guarantee a perfect final result.<br />
        In the  post-operative period, before you see the improvement in your appearance, you  will probably go through a typical period where you can look somewhat battered  and bruised followed by another temporary period when you will look  &quot;strange&quot; to yourself. Some patients may experience a temporary  period of slight emotional depression right after surgery. <br />
        This will  be at a time when the patient looks the worst. It is not easy to look swollen  and bruised specially when natural expectations are toward an improved  appearance. Such feelings are very normal; fortunately, they pass by quickly.<br />
        Each  individual varies considerably. Most patients are able to appear in public  around three weeks after surgery, although some camouflaging may be needed. You  should get aside about three weeks until you become &quot;sociably  acceptable&quot;.<br />
        If you have  questions about your surgery, be sure to have them answered in advance, either  by my office staff or me. Well-meaning friends are not good source of  information. Many of my staff has been with me for years. All of them are  thoroughly informed, trained and able to answer most questions, which may occur  to you. Find out everything that you want to know from us. A well-informed  happy patient is our ultimate goal.<br />
        Actually, I  perform all surgeries on my patients. My trained personnel will assist me. I  and my expert team of associates and assistants who are continually in touch  with me will do the post-operative care and follow-ups. It is not possible for  me to see you on all of your post-operative visits or answer all your phone  calls. If I am not available, my well-trained staff will carry out your care.<br />
      The  techniques I perform are a compilation of personal experience, ideas gathered  over the years from attendance at meetings throughout the world, observation of  other surgeons, and by simply keeping my eyes and ears open to my patients suggestions.  In addition to techniques that are safe and facile, an organized care regimen  will be provided from pre to postoperative status in order to obtain  consistent, predictable, and aesthetically pleasing results.</p>
<p><br />
        <strong>&nbsp;THINGS TO REMEMBER</strong><br />
        Feel free  to ask any questions about your proposed surgery or our policies. During the  evaluation, it is necessary for us to know all your questions about the surgery  you are requesting.<br />
        Please  advise us of any medical condition you might have: medications you take,  possible allergies to drugs, ointments, soaps, etc.<br />
        Smoking is  known to delay healing. When you smoke the blood supply to the skin is reduced.  To minimize possible complications such as skin loss, lack of healing and bad  scarring, smokers must refrain from using tobacco one week before and two weeks  after surgery.<br />
        If you are  having facial surgery bring a hat, sunglass, sunblock and a scarf (women).<br />
        Overweight  patients usually have not as good results as normal weight people. If you are  obese or overweight, you are in more risk of having complications, the surgery  is more difficult and the results will be inferior and less lasting. In order  to achieve the best results it is highly advisable to lose weight before the  surgery.<br />
        We request  no drinking alcoholic beverages, avoid smoking, and no sun exposure one week  before and two weeks after surgery.<br />
    &quot;While  we make every effort to achieve the best surgical result, we want your  experience to be safe and pleasant&quot; Ronald Pino, MD</p></td>

    <td><p><strong>Pre-payment</strong><br />
      Pre-payment  is customary for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. These treatments do not constitute  an emergency. The patient should have sufficient time to plan ahead and arrange  his/her finances. We request a US $500 deposit one-month before the scheduled  surgery. The total amount of surgical fees must be paid the day before surgery.  This way guarantees that the patient is not under-taking the elective surgery  which she/he cannot afford.<br />
      Payment may  be done in cash, traveler's checks, or cashier checks to the order of Dr.  Ronald Pino. We accept major credit cards. Personal checks are accepted only if  it is received in our office at least two weeks before surgery.<br />
  <strong>Cancellations</strong><br />
      30 days  before the scheduled surgery, the full amount will be refund. Between 30 and 8  days before surgery, we will charge $100 for administrative costs. Less than 8  days, no refund of the $500 deposit. If the surgery is canceled for medical reasons,  the total amount will be refunded.<br />
  <strong>Medical Insurance</strong><br />
      When  surgery is done solely for aesthetic purposes, medical insurance will not pay  for the hospital bill or the surgical procedure. If the surgery is  reconstructive in nature or done for functional reasons, insurance may defray  some or all the costs.<br />
    We will be  happy to help you fill out the insurance claim, provide copies of the operative  reports and photographs to your insurance company, at a little extra cost. The  insurance company is responsible to you, not to us. Likewise, patients not  their insurance carriers are responsible for any charges incurred for services  rendered. It is not possible to fill out insurance forms to pretend the surgery  done was not for cosmetic purposes if indeed, it was.</p></td>
