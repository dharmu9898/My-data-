      <p>Cosmetic dentistry is changing people's lives for the better, giving them not only a healthy mouth and a bright smile, but perhaps more significantly, a renewed confidence. Our dentists are deeply proud of their own particular expertise and the entire team - receptionists, nurses and dentists - speak English, making communication simple and easy.</p>

      <p>In the UK quality dental treatment has become the reserve of the wealthy. The price you have to pay puts such treatment beyond the pockets of all but a select few. </p>
      <p>With our knowledge of the Hungarian market we can offer customers first class dental treatment at a fraction of the local cost. </p>
      <p>There aren't many people who actually enjoy going to the dentist, so it's understandable why suggesting that people go to a foreign country to have dental treatment can be a bit of a leap of faith. </p>
      <p>For this reason we have gone out of our way to make the experience with Access Smile something really special. </p>
      <p>Everything about our service is first class. From the initial call to the completion of the treatment plan, we look after our clients' every need.<br />

      Feedback from the UK<br />
      &ldquo;I really couldn't recommend Access Smile highly enough. All the staff were utterly charming. The dentist I saw was gentle, sympathetic and clearly had the highest professional standards; she did really good work on my teeth and I needed a lot of work. I'd had an estimate in Britain of 8 hours and &pound;1000 for just one tooth. The dentist in Budapest did the preparation work on 19 teeth in six and a half hours and the whole thing, including the most expensive crowns available (which are metal-free and therefore look like real teeth) cost around &pound;4,000. The most impressive thing was that because the dentist was so gentle and sympathetic, six and a half hours in the dentist's chair really wasn't that bad. It was tiring though and I felt fragile afterwards so the fact that Access Smile then drove me back to where I was staying (and ferried me back and forth to all subsequent appointments) really made a huge difference. I am so glad I went. My partner is planning to go too! &rdquo;</p>
      <p>Rose Cameron, Manchester <br />
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;On arrival at the clinic, the high quality of the premises and the high-tech scanning X-ray equipment immediately dispelled any remaining fears that this might be a &quot;budget&quot; operation. My dentist was extremely competent and professional. I was impressed that she was willing to work until 7:00 PM in order finish my preparation work in a single session. The customer service staff were also very helpful.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Ken Clark, Aberdeen <br />
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I want to thank all of your valued team from the bottom of my heart for helping me so much, looking after me and taking me seriously when so many dentists have not in the UK.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Julie Bowden, Manchester<br />
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I am extremely pleased with my treatment. I have no hesitation in recommending your clinic in Hungary. All the support staff and the dentists conversed easily in English and were very helpful and professional in their approach. &rdquo;</p>
      <p>Brian Pritchard<br />
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I want to let you know how pleased and happy I am with my veneers. Please would you pass on my thanks, once again, to Gabrielle and especially to the technician who did such a great job, even coming into the clinic to see me. Thanks also to Adrienne. We have been very impressed with the level of professionalism and service you have given us and will recommend you to everyone!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you so much for giving me the wonderful smile I have always dreamed of. I have been touched by your kindness and cannot thank you all enough. You have made my experience so much more enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>
