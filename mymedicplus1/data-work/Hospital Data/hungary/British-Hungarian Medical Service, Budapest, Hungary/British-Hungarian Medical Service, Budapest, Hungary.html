      <p><strong>Safe, professional, friendly, cost effective ...<br />
        </strong><br />
      Cosmetic Dentistry Abroad - BHMS specialises strictly in treating foreign patients, more specifically patients from the UK and Ireland. It is very important for clients who are looking for dental treatment abroad to ask questions before go overseas for treatment and the following questions should be asked:</p>
      <p><strong>How long have you been treating foreign patients?</strong><br />
      Our cosmetic dentistry is a long established surgery and have been treating UK patients since 2006, so you are in professional hands, with people who understand your needs and know how to offer the very best service available. Our dentists in Budapest are registered with the General Dental Council, the organisation which regulates dental professionals in the UK.</p>
      <p><strong>How experienced are your dentists in Budapest?</strong><br />
      Our dentists have many, many years of combined experience and regularly attend courses to ensure that they learn the newest techniques and are continually improving themselves. Both oral surgeons , Dr. Batorfi and Dr. Halasz are extremely professional and highly skilled do nothing other than implant surgery and bone grafting procedures, hence having vast experience in this field of expertise. It must be noted that many new dentistries appearing on the internet do not have the vast experience that is offered at BHMS.</p>
      <p><strong>What happens if something goes wrong?</strong><br />
        Please contact your UK rep immediately. There may be several solutions to a problem, however, if you need to see a dentist, you can either return to Budapest where all treatment will be carried our free of charge or if you prefer to see a dentist in London, then a one-off consultation fee of &pound;40 is charged.</p>
      <p>Make contact with BHMS and arrange free a consultation in Budapest. <br />
        We will help you to find the cheapest flights and book your accommodation <br />
        Continuous correspondence - we remain in constant contact with you while you are here in Budapest. If you have any questions or concerns, we are here to help. <br />
        Prefer to go to London? No problem, we can arrange the consultation in London for a nominal fee of &pound;40 (deducted from the cost of your treatment if you book an appointment within 2 weeks to take place within 3 month). <br />
        Bring your own x-ray, don't have one? We can do a panoramic x-ray for an additional fee of &pound;40. (Call our friendly UK reps for appointments) <br />
        <br />
        02 Arrange your appointment with our dental surgery and arrive to Budapest <br />

      Please read some testimonials of previous patients who have already experienced the advantages of having dental treatment or dental implant surgery abroad. These patients went to BHMS clinic in Budapest to have dental treatment and they were totally satisfied with the results. Their personal experience proves that it worth travelling to Hungary and having dental treatment abroad, especially dental implant surgery where huge savings can be made.</p>
    <p>If you wish to speak to any of these previous clients who have been kind enough to write about their expeiences, please call me, Agnes on 020 8399 8663,  and I will gladly put you in touch with them<br />

    <p>Hi Agnes <br />
      Just arrived back from Budapest and wanted to say a big thank you to you and the whole team, especially my dentist Dr Janos Schmidt.  I am so very happy with the end result I cannot describe it. At the start of this week the dentist suggested I have my front teeth crowned also which I was happy to do, but going through that process I did begin to feel what am I doing, is this going to be worth it. Well at 10.45 this morning when I had finished the whole treatment and had my other teeth cleaned, I walked down the stairs and smiled at my husband, he was taken aback at how lovely my smile was.  I have not stopped smiling since, he is fed up looking at my big smile! :-)) </p>
    <p>Everything has been so worthwhile, also the way you all organise everything is fantastic, I would certainly recommend you.  I am going to return and have implants to the bottom in the future.  Can you please pass my thanks to the team in Budapest. </p>
    <p>Take care <br />

    <p>I have come from a position where I had teeth knocked out as a teenager through sport, then gone through the following 15 years with crowns and them a plate when they failed. I found this to be thoroughly unpleasant and demoralising-there was not a day, for whatever number of years it was, that I did not hate wearing my false teeth! If you are reading this you probably know exactly what I mean-I really, really detested it!</p>
    <p>I had read more and more about implants and had moved dentist, from my original NHS dentist to a private dentist in the UK. My reason behind this was that I knew one of the dentists there was branching out to specialise in implants. I was very impressed by the difference in private V's NHS in the UK (but was later to be amazed at how much better private was in Budapest!!) I had visited the dentist in the UK who specialised in implants and was flabbergasted when I was quoted &pound;2000 for the ONE implant, as well as another bill for &pound;2000 that was essential (According to him) for a bone graft into the jaw as well-so I was looking at &pound;4000 for the one tooth to be replaced.</p>
    <p>Shocked by this I was encouraged by a BBC One show report on dental tourism to look into dentistry abroad. I googled a few and contatced three outlining my situation. One did not bother to reply even after I contacted them twice, but two did. Another contatced me with a girl whose English was limited, and the third, British Hungarian Medical Service (BHMS) contatced me via Agnes Tuba, their UK representative. Her english was perfect and she was always exceptionally helpful throughout-and indeed was always contactable by phone or email-this was a great source of reassurance.<br />
      I eventually ploughed through reviews and tripadvisor reports etc and gathered up the guts to commit to treatment......(remember I was going to get one implant-though had space for four)<br />
      I made the arrangements for my first visit-which was very daunting-I couldn't locate Budapest on a map or tell you anything about it!<br />
      The practice kept in touch during the days before departure and the safety of someone to collect you at the airport is a godsend! I had my initial consultation with Dr. Bal&aacute;zs Gyovai who was the dentist I then saw most of during my visits. I had previously requested that Dr Batorfi do the implants as he has the best reputation from everything I had read. On consultation with Dr Gyovai we discussed the opportunities in my mouth and I committed to getting all four gaps filled!!!!!........and the real dealbreaker was the fact that the implants were coming in around &pound;900 each..............and no bone graft needed............for FOUR implants!! (April 2008 prices)<br />
      It took three trips to complete the treatments, but every one was completed to a very high standard-the fitting of the implants was the most frightening part, but I am delighted to report-as someone who has had a host of dental treatments, it really was nothing too awful.......afterwards it isn't very pleasant-like getting a tooth pulled, some swelling and mild discomfort, and the insertion of a temporary plate- but on reflection it is entirely worth it!<br />
      Three months later I returned to be fitted for the teeth to attach to the implants, and then a week later for the final fitting. Dr Tunde Toth completed the fitting process, again with Dr Gyovai always available and providing continuity across the service. It has taken me a while to get used to having teeth again-without any doubt my four implants are now the strongest teeth in my mouth!! They are slightly bigger on the inside of the mouth than your natural teeth-due to the construction on the inside, but less than a year later I wouldn't notice it at all.<br />
      I would strongly encourage anyone who is reading this and wavering over the thought of it to take the plunge-there has not been a moment where I have regretted it-perhaps my only regret is that I did not get more done!!<br />
      The prospect of travelling to Budapest is slightly daunting, English is not very prominent, but the clinic-and in particular Bianca and Katalin at the desks are extremely helpful and friendly and will set you at ease. Budapest is a very busy city, but the clinic sits at the outskirts of the city in a very pleasant residential area-it is just a run of the mill house converted into a great clinic. The clinic will always collect you and leave you back to you accommodation. I had booked my own hotels, but was very impressed by reports of other patients in the waiting area who had used the clinics recommmended apartments.<br />
      I am just about to book my visit for April/May next year for a check up and have raved to anyone who has asked me about the service provided and especially the outcome!!!&quot; </p>

    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>Recently I underwent some dental treatment at the British  Hungarian Medical Services in Budapest, Hungary and I cannot praise them enough for the work which they did on my teeth.  I had my bite corrected which required every tooth to be crowned along with a couple of bridges and my wisdom teeth removed. </p>
    <p>I live in an area which is struggling to attract dentists and I had a longterm problem with my bite which had resulted in my teeth becoming severely worn down causing me discomfort and looking unsightly.  Unfortunately I'm a very nervous patient and had left seeking dental treatment for a very long time.  When I did try to get treatment I visited several local dentists on a private basis but none were willing to undertake the work as they admitted it was too complex work for them.  Eventually I found a clinic 200 miles away willing to do the treatment for &pound;30000, but I could not afford this.   After recovering from the shock I searched the internet and found the British Hungarian Medical Services and contacted Agnes who was extremely helpful and I subsequently made an appointment in London to see one of their representatives.  Just over 2 weeks later I arrived in Budapest to begin treatment.  I was picked up from the airport and for every dental appointment.  The price quoted before I travelled was exactly what I paid - no hidden extras. </p>
    <p>All the staff at the clinic were very friendly and immediately put me at ease.  Their expertise and dedication is second to none and I can't believe the result, all my friends comment on how much it has improved my appearance..  Not only was I overcome with emotion when I saw my new teeth but I could clearly see how proud the staff were of their work.</p>
    <p> <br />
      However, the best thing was that I saved 70% off the cost of my treatment by having it done by the British Hungarian Medical Services in Budapest and enjoyed a lovely holiday in Budapest which is a beautiful city.  I could never have afforded my treatment in England but thanks to them I now have a smile to be proud of and it has given me so much more confidence. </p>
    <p> <br />
      I would not hesitate to recommend the British Hungarian Medical Services in Budapest for any dental treatment as they have specialists in all areas of dental treatment and I met many satisfied customers undergoing various treatments whilst I was there. </p>

    <p>Dear Agnes</p>
    <p>I am delighted with my my dental implants and with the entire service from BHMS. As a child I was appalled at the false teeth which so many adults I knew had to use, and I hoped it would never happen to me. Years later when my various crowns and bridges began to give way the prospect of the dreaded dentures loomed and although by then implants had been developed the cost in the UK was prohibitive. I was so relieved when a friend showed me a newspaper article about dental tourism. I researched the internet and BHMS offered by the far the best deal. Right from the start BHMS made everything go so smoothly; a UK representative to answer my telephone queries beforehand, a minicab at the airport to drive me straight to the impeccable dental clinic and the welcome and friendliness of the staff, then a cab back to the hotel they had booked for me, even a cab to the airport for my homeward journey. The same high quality of care was continued when I returned for the crowns to be fitted after the implants had settled in. I was delighted with my flashy new teeth and, especially, that I had a bite like a Rottweiler! When some other teeth began to deteriorate I had no hesitation in deciding on implants rather than other kinds of conservation and this time used the monthly dental surgery which BHMS have set up in London. My London dentist has strongly approved the work and so many people have been interested in my treatment and feel reassured that if and when they need them, they can have implants at a high standard of care at an affordable price; it's really something to smile about! </p>

    <p>BHMS is great.</p>
    <p>Deterioration seemed irreversible.  Eating an apple or a steak was a fading memory.  In the UK, the verdict seemed to be that implants might not be possible, and in any case would take a year and cost a fortune.</p>
    <p>We found Budapest and BHMS.  We checked everything as carefully as we could, and then finally went along.</p>
    <p>From Agnes, our rep in the UK, to our dentists Drs Balasz Gyovai and T&#369;nde Toth and  chief surgeon Dr Bela Batorfi, and on to Katalin who deals with money, the BHMS team is professional and a pleasure to work with.  The dentists and surgeons are fast, efficient and impressively skilful. </p>
    <p>I found out that Budapest is a great place to visit as well.  But now that BHMS has consultations in London, we can choose to have checkups and aftercare right here.</p>
    <p>On the web site, they say costs are low because wages are lower.  I don&rsquo;t think it is that.  I think BHMS is well managed with an efficient system that uses expert specialists to do what they are best at.  I have had extensive dental treatment in the USA and in London.  I have no intention of going back.  BHMS is better.</p>
    <p>And now I eat apples and steaks, no pain, no discomfort.</p>

    <p>Hi Agnes,<br />
      I thought I would just let you know that my recent trip out to Budapest, to have the final part of the procedure for implants completed, went perfectly.  I am delighted with my new teeth and have already once again enjoyed the joys of eating a good steak!  Dr. Balazs was very patient with me and was very thorough in ensuring that everything was just right before I left for the UK. My wife and I enjoyed staying at the Town Hall apartments (highly recommended) and doing some sightseeing.  We were lucky to be able to visit the &quot;Bodies&quot; exhibition (absolutely amazing!), just down the street from the apartment, and also enjoyed a concert in the Basillica.<br />
      Thank you very much for your support, and rest asured I am recommending BHMS to anyone who needs dental work.<br />
      Kind regards,<br />

    <p>Dear Agnes, I am sorry, I haven't written to you sooner, which is something I plan every day, yet somehow don't find the time to do. I just wanted you to know that my teeth are fabulous and I can eat anything and everything.  In the end, it was well worth the suffering.  I think of you and the rest of the team on a daily basis as I am truly grateful for all your efforts. Would you please pass on my best regards and best wishes to everybody in Budapest and tell them I  think of them daily.  Lots of  love,   Sibylla xxx

    <p>Dear Agnes</p>
    <p>Just quick note to thank you for all your help with my Budapest visits.</p>
    <p>Everything went according to plan last week and I am extremely pleased with the result both as a fit and for colour.</p>
    <p>The apartment was excellent and well located and had it not been for the weather the week would have been perfect. (We suffered the worst day on record for Budapest temperature in July on Wednesday when as well as incessant rain it was only 12C degrees.)</p>
    <p>Once again many thanks and I look forward (????) to the next time I require dental work.</p>
    <p>All the Best<br />
      DERRY<br />

    <p>From Stuart Curren - Implants </p>
    <p>Hi Agnes</p>
    <p>Just a few words on my visit to Hungary<br />
      I have to say that the treatment I received was excellent. I was very nervous but the dentist was very good with me assuring me I would be ok and feel no pain he was spot on. The treatment was painless and I suffered not one second of pain or discomfort from the implants during or after. The only pain I had and still have is from the extraction (attempted) by the alleged dentist I had to use at the hospital in Darlington. The dentist in Hungary took more time trying and succeeding to get out the roots that had been left in than it took to do two implants.<br />

    <p>I have to say, I am extremely happy with my nashers + have had lots of compliments which is always very nice. Some people have asked for your details so I will of course pass them on. </p>
    <p>Everybody at the surgery were absolutely marvellous + looked after us so well. I absolutely adored the female dentist whose name escapes me (she actually said she was the &quot;fairy dentist&quot; when I asked her name, bless! (Dr Tunde Toth) she was so gentle + kind please pass on my thanks. They seem such a happy bunch + appear to really enjoy what they do there. </p>
    <p>I went to see uncle Bill + Linda this evening + both their nashers look good but my o my, Linda's are absolutely fantastic + she is over the moon with them. Poor uncle Bill said that nobody talks about his teeth. I said it was a woman thing ha ha. he was only joking of course + says he is so happy for linda because she has been through so much treatment. I still haven't seen Laura's yet but you can imagine when the whole family get together, the conversation will only be one thing!! </p>
    <p>Once again, thanks to all of you for your wonderful service + expertise.</p>
    <p>Right I must dash now. Got 2 get out there + do a bit more smiling</p>

    <p>Hi Agnes,<br />
      Just thought I would drop you a line to let you know how it went in Budapest, (a bit easier than talking at the moment).<br />
      Landed on time and was greeted at the airport as arranged.Transfer to the clinic was smooth, by taxi as there were other patients traveling at the same time. My appointment was delayed, which meant waiting around, but we were given food as it would be a while before I could eat again.<br />
      I think my procedure went well,Dr. Batorfi seems a man of few words and did not comment on it. I was given ice packs and pain relief with an aftercare plan. Some impressions were taken by Dr. Gyovai so as to make my temporary denture and an appointment made for the following afternoon. <br />
      The apartment was very nice, I would like to stay there again on my return, as it is central enough to do some sight-seeing. We had time to walk down to the river and across the chain bridge before returning to the clinic to receive my denture.<br />
      Because of the swelling and tenderness of the gum they did not fit it fully. They said to leave it out as much as possible to allow the area to heal. If when I need to wear it I have any problems I'll let you know.<br />
      The swelling has started to go down, but it may take a while, I look quite thuggish with my black eye. I'm off work until Monday so hopefully it will have cleared up a bit by then.</p>
    <p>Phase 2, I may have done in London due to the cost of flights and time needed to travel to Budapest, and any check-ups needed before that I would also look to having done here.</p>
    <p>Many thanks to all the team, it's quite a traumatic thing to go through and they all helped make it as pleasant as possible.</p>
    <p>Kind Regards Ian</p>

    <p>From Dirk Smith </p>
    <p>Sorry Agnes I couldn't do it in just a few words.So used lots hahaha, But have allowed my e-mail to be used should any one wish to contact me. <br />
    </p>
    <p>At first like every other person who is seeking medical/dental treatment, in my case dental treatment, I looked around in the UK. After visiting many different dentists and paying them a consultation fee every time which was usually over &pound;100 I was told that implants was an option for me but the cost to have such work done in the UK was just ridicules, over &pound;2000 per implant and the cost of the tooth on top of about &pound;300 to &pound;400 pounds. I had prepared to accept that wearing a denture plate was it, even though I had had it privately made at the cost of over &pound;280 it was unbearable, I couldn't eat or drink with it without having it dislodging at some time during a meal, even simple things like whistling the dog was beyond the plate. In truth I hated it from the start and found myself wearing it less. So with great scepticism I approached Agnes Tuba via e-mail who is the British &ndash; Hungarian UK Representative. I made an appointment and went to see the dental practice. Agnes arranged every thing except flights. I was collected at the airport and taken to a very nice reasonably priced apartment. From the apartment I was collected and taken to the surgery every time, The surgery was spotless and very modern, in fact it would have put most dental surgeries I have visited in the UK to shame, all the staff spoke English and every detail was explained and costs were all discussed at every stage leaving you in no doubt as to were you stood. After the usual consultation that was free I was given the opportunity to have the implant at almost 1/3 of the cost in the UK. Well I couldn't resist and had it done there and then. The procedure was quick and relatively painless, I had no problems after and maintained a strict oral hygiene routine at all times. I was taken to and from the airport and to and from the surgery by taxi or by their own drivers and this service is one they offer free a good saving yet again. I visited again after 4 months was collected and dropped off as usual and then again a few weeks after that to have the tooth fitted, job done. My overall saving was about &pound;1000, and now once again I can eat what ever I like and whistle the dog as loud as I wish. I now that if you're reading this you're in the same predicament as I was. You read the stories in the press about the UK dental association advising people not to go and have dental work abroad and stating horrifying facts, let's face it its not in there interests for the clients to get a cheaper alternative, the irony in my case was that the treatment I received was by far superior to any treatment I have received in the UK. I would recommend to any person living in the UK and looking at paying a fortune for dental work to go to them and try it after all the consultation in Hungary is free the airfare is about &pound;50 with a budget airline so it&rsquo;s still cheaper then paying over &pound;100 for consultation in the UK. You have nothing to loose. I hope that this short account of my dealings with the British &ndash; Hungarian medical service surgery is of help to you. If you have any questions to me my e-mail is D-SMITH@talktalk.net or contact Agnes. All the best. </p>

    <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>I am absolutely thrilled with the very high quality and natural appearance of the major dental work done for me by the team at the British Hungarian Medical Service. Every aspect of the service provided for the treatment was both seamless and professional. This, together with the care and kindness shown to me by all the staff, made a huge difference to me as a very nervous patient.</p>
    <p>As well as the excellent quality, the overall cost of the work was only about 25% of what I was being quoted in London and so I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending the British Hungarian Medical Service to any one considering cosmetic dental work, especially for dental implants.&quot;</p>
    <p>Best wishes and a happy Christmas and New Year. Chris and Barbara</p>
