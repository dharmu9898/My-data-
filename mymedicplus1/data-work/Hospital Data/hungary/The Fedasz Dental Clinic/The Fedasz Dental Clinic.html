      <strong>Dr. J&oacute;zsef N&eacute;metv&ouml;lgyi Dentist -  Implantologist </strong><strong><br />
        </strong>I was born in Budapest - Hungary,  in 1959. I received my diploma at the Dentistry  School of the Semmelweis Medical   University, in 1983. My  first workplace was at the dentistry department of the Kisb&eacute;ri Hospital.<br />
      I passed my special examine in 1985, the subject was illnesses of teeth and  mouth. Between 1983 and 1995, I healed my patients in Kisb&eacute;r. In 1989, I was  constituted as the dentist of the neighborhood.<br />
      I have joined Fedasz Dental in 1995, and I am still working here. Our  environment is of high standard in every respect, and I have every possibility  for the high-level working thanks to the modern offices.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Gabriella Borsos - DDS, specialist  in orthodontics</strong> <br />
        After graduating from the Semmelweis University in dentistry in 1994, I spent  two years as a postgraduate student in orthodontics in Germany. I came back to Hungary in 1998 and worked for a year at the  Clinic of Pedodontics and Orthodontics of the Semmelweis University.  Since 1999 I've worked at the Department of Orthodontics of the Heim Pal  Children's Hospital. I'm a specialist in dentistry (1998) and in orthodontics  (2000). <br />
        I'm a member of the European Orthodontist Society, the American Association  of the Orthodontists and the World Federation of Orthodontists. Beside the  curative activity I do some research. The main field is the anchorage problems  during the orthodontic treatment. I've published and presented in Hungary and  abroad about the use of orthodontic implants. I'm glad, that I can use my  experiences for the benefit of the patients of the Fedasz Dental Clinic. </p>
      <p><strong>Dr. G&aacute;bor Kamar&aacute;s Dentist -  Implantologist</strong> <br />
        I was born on 29th of May in 1976 in Ajka. I received my diploma at the Dentistry  Faculty of the Semmelweis Medical University Budapest in 2003. During my school  years I joined and successfully finished an implantology special course. In  2003 I started to work to a private dental clinic in Budapest where I had the opportunity to learn  the newest techniques in dentistry. <br />
    In 2006 I passed the exam to be a specialist in tooth and mouth diseases. I  am proud to be a part of the Fedasz Dental team where in a friendly atmosphere  and with professional colleagues I can always reach the best result. </p></td>

        <strong>Dental Services, Dental Care, Surgeries  equipped with latest technology</strong><br />
The Fedasz Dental Surgery Budapest is equipped with the highest technology  like: dental implant surgery system, comfortable multifunctional chairs,  fiber-optic instruments, soft laser for the healing of the 'mucous membrane',  panorama X-ray and conscious sedation equipment. This helps our dentists and  specialists in their work, and gives a comfort level and satisfaction to our  patients.<br />
<strong>Fedasz Dental Laboratory - Dental  Technicians</strong><br />
Fedasz Dental belongs to those few private dental clinics in Budapest that has its own on-site dental  laboratory. The dental technician team enjoys working with the most Up-To-Date  equipments, machines and technology, witch allows us to start and finish all  types of dental artwork, sometimes in less than a week! Normally our deadlines  for all types of cosmetic dentistry are of one week. In November of 1995, our  dental laboratory was awarded with the &quot;I.W.C. Laboratory&quot;  certification of the German BEGO company.<br />

        <strong>Basic treatment</strong><strong><br />
          </strong>Every new treatment is started first with a fully comprehensive  status examination. <br />
        It consists of the following steps:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>preliminary examination </li>
        <li>X-Ray photographs in panorama       or full zoom </li>
        <li>oral oscular hygiene       examinations </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goal of the panorama X-Ray is not only the status examination of the  sore tooth, but also the examination of the whole jowl and the maxillary sinus.  This way doctors can see the incidental cysts or other inflammations that can  affect the whole body.<br />
        Following the above &ndash; depending on the patient's status &ndash; specialists give a  recommendation about the removal of tartar, the extraction of the tooth,  implantation or the preparation of crowns/bridges and dentures.<br />
  <strong>Sleepless sedation</strong><strong><br />
  </strong><em>(Master Flux Automatic AS 3000)</em><br />
        Dental &quot;antiphobia&quot; and analgesing machine<br />
        Patients, who need dental services, are usually afraid of the dental  treatment, so there is an increasing need not only for the painless treatment,  but also for the fearless and phobia-proof one.<br />
        The relaxing gas decreases the patient's fear and phobia of a dental  treatment.<br />
        This gas relaxes the patient by which:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>pain threshold of the patient       increases, so painkilling becomes stronger </li>
        <li>patient remains sleepless and       collaborating </li>
        <li>gullet-reflexes remain       working </li>
        <li>treatment is faster </li>
        <li>Rate between nitrogen-oxidul       and oxygen can be set with Master Flux sleepless sedating machine       arbitrarily (0-70%) accordingly to the patient's need. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using of Master Flux is absolutely safe. Pure dinox gas cannot be  transferred into the lung since oxygen controls the flow of gases. <br />
        Master Flux can also be used in the case of sickness or urgency: inhalation  with oxygen or assisted breathing is possible. <br />
  <strong>Dental Implant Hungary,  Cosmetic Dentistry</strong><br />
        Dental implants are fixtures of titanium that are directly attached to your jawbone.  Dental implants can last a lifetime and are an excellent investment in oral  health. Once anchored in place, your dental implants can be used to replace a  missing tooth, an entire set of teeth, bridges or partial dentures. Implant  dentistry is the modern method of replacing missing teeth. Research shows that  85 percent of people who wear full or partial dentures experience some related  discomfort and difficulty. Dental implants can eliminate those problems,  restore self-confidence and improve the quality of life.<br />
  <strong>In what kind of circumstances is  implantation possible?</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Good general health </li>
        <li>Sufficient thickness of the       jawbone </li>
        <li>Perfect hygiene in the mouth </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>At what kind of illnesses is  implantation not recommended?</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Serious immunological       problems </li>
        <li>Serious diabetes </li>
        <li>Tumors </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What is the age limit for an implantation and how permanent it is?  Implantation is always possible, if general health permits and adequately thick  bones are available. Through correct treatment and well-made implantation,  carried by the prosthetic root, permanency has no limits.<br />
        <strong>Can allergy or bad headaches occur  because of the dental implants?</strong><br />
        Implants are made of high purity titanium. This metal has a special  biological property and the bone can join to it. There is no published occurrence  of implantation related allergic or tumor degeneration in the technical  literature. Its surface is covered by a stabile compound, titanium-oxide. This  compound does not dissolve in bodily fluids, therefore it does not enter into  reaction with the immune system either. If the implantation technique and  structure are correct, implants can serve for a lifetime.<br />
  <strong>Can implants fall out?</strong><strong><br />
  </strong>Bad hygiene in the mouth, the fur and tartar deposited on the  implant similarly to natural teeth can cause illnesses. These can involve  stripping in the prosthesis root.<br />
  <strong>Tooth whitening, teeth whitening,  bleaching</strong><strong><br />
  <strong>Why are teeth colored?</strong></strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>due to physique reasons some       people have darker permanent teeth </li>
        <li>effect of strong coloring       materials (coffee, tea, smoking) </li>
        <li>older fillings </li>
        <li>treatment of the root can       also cause coloration of teeth </li>
        <li>effect of some medicines:       tetracycline (for example tetran, doxycycline) during teeth growth,       fluoride overdose. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>About the treatment:</strong><br />
        The fastest way to get your glamour smile is the 30 minute in-office procedure.  The system hat we are using is called Pola Office. The instant result in just  about 30 minutes can be done by a quick trip to our clinic, which is done by  our dentists. <br />
  <em>Steps that our dentists will perform on your  teeth:</em></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Your teeth are cleaned. </li>
        <li>A white resign barrier is       applied to the gum areas surrounding the teeth. This will protect your       gums. </li>
        <li>A hydrogen peroxide blue gel       is applied to each tooth. </li>
        <li>A standard dental light       shines on each tooth for about 30 seconds each. </li>
        <li>The gel is taken off your       teeth using suction. </li>
        <li>Your dentist will repeat       steps 3-5 about two more times. </li>
        <li>At the end you will be asked       to look in the mirror at your whiter teeth. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Can fillings or bridges be whiten?</strong><br />
        Unfortunately not. It is practical to consider the color at the preparation of  prosthesis and fillings, so that they are in harmony with the new tooth color.<br />
  <strong>How long the whitening effect will last?</strong><br />
        Usually whitening is effective for years. Naturally, it depends on the  person and the consumed food. <br />
  <strong>What can we do to prevent the next  coloring?</strong><br />
        We can decrease the coloring by consuming less coffee, tea, red wine or other  colour containing food, and by cutting back on smoking.<br />
        Light color of the teeth can be maintained by one-two day long &quot;reminding&quot;  whitening from time to time.<br />
  <strong>Orthodontia</strong><br />
        Orderliness of teeth is very important. Incorrectly, standing teeth determine  mastication, speech as well as aesthetic exterior. Additionally, teeth leaning  forward / backwards / sidelong or cut at bad place are more prone to cavity,  because they are more difficult to clean. In some far-gone cases, these teeth  can cause problems and aches with the chewing-joint. The orthodontic machine  drives these teeth towards their normal place.<br />
        The orthodontic machine gives a gentle, controlled force to the  &quot;renitent&quot; teeth. This gentle force in a considerable time can move  teeth to the desired position. Due to the continuous force the bone is becoming  rebuilt: at the pressure-place it is decaying, and at the tension-place it is  piling up.<br />
        At first brackets (wire-holding guide) are sticks with the fixed orthodontic  machine for every tooth (on the upper or lower denture, or booth). Then a  special wire is laid down in a guide fixed at every bracket. The wire's  flexibility gives the desired force and this continuous force moves teeth to  the desired position. Transparent, discrete brackets are available too, and it  is also possible to attach these to the inside of the teeth, so aesthetically  they are almost undetectable.<br />
        Removable orthodontic machine has to be worn at night and by day, the longer  the better. This machine works the same way as the fixed one, but is less  efficient. It is used at smaller or minor dental abnormalities.</p>

    <td><p><strong>Fisrt Class Treatment in a First Class Clinic</strong></p>
      <p>My sincere gratitude to the Fedasz Dental Team in particular to Levente and Dr. J&oacute;zsef N&eacute;metv&ouml;lgyi. I traveled to Budapest last month to undergo treatment and cannot say enough about the superiour level of treatment I received. </p>
      <p>Having received a quote for approx. &euro;2000 to have root canal treatment and a Crown made for one tooth (yes a single tooth), I decided to look outside of Ireland for dental treatment. Following numerous internet searches and extensive research, my mind was quickly made up - The impressive web site and prompt email &amp; phone responses I received from the Fedasz Team were more than enough to sway my decision. </p>
      <p>As I was travelling with a friend, I decided not to avail of the offer of free accommodation. Instead, I booked my own accommodation in Budapest and made my own way to the apartment on arrival. </p>
      <p>The evening before my first appointment, I received a phonecall from Levente to ensure that I had arrived and make arrangements to be picked up the next day. As arranged, I was picked up at my apartment and driven to the clinic. Following a tour of the lab, treatment rooms and accommodation I met my dentist Dr. J&oacute;zsef N&eacute;metv&ouml;lgyi. </p>
      <p>I'll not bore you with the details, but let it suffice to say that the treatment (and treatment costs) were exactly in line with what had been quoted per email in advance and the quality of service was as good as, or better than, any I have received anywhere else in the world. (Having lived in Germany for almost 7 years and spent 3 years traveling around the world, I have had my fair share of &quot;foreign&quot; dental treatment.) </p>
      <p>The level of customer service and personal attention I received was second to none.</p>

        <strong>NHS Check up after treatment at Fedasz</strong></p>
      <p>I have just been for an NHS check up having had work done at Fedasz. </p>
      <p>I was expecting a hostile reception when I told my dentist I had been to Hungary, but she smiled and told me she was going to inspect the work very closely. </p>
      <p>Having done so, she was very complimentary, and asked if I would object to her two partners having a look. </p>
      <p>They were all very curious about Hungary and about the clinic at Fedasz. I have never in my life been subjected to such close scrutiny at an NHS dentist. </p>
      <p>They were all aware of the growing trend towards dental travel, but clearly I was the first returning patient they had had the opportunity to inspect. <br />
        The reaction, when I revealed the cost of my treatment including the free accommodation and transportation, was bordering on disbelief. </p>
      <p>Their individual assessment and joint conclusion was that the work was superb, and it was money very well spent. </p>
      <p>See main report on treatment at Fedasz (including picture) Are you Hungary for a nice smile? <br />
      </p>
      <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
        <strong>Just completed my treatment at Fedasz</strong></p>
      <p>I cannot speak highly enough of the service I received at Fedasz. I was over for ten days, as I was asking for a lot of cosmetic work on healthy teeth that I felt were unsightly (I am 34). I also needed some implants and bridges at the back and wanted all my fillings replaced with white material. I think I was one of their more difficult customers, as I had a very fixed idea of what I wanted my teeth to look like and I was not going to compromise on that. </p>
      <p>The dentists and clinic are nothing like what you experience in England. The equipment is far more advanced and the working area is immaculately clean. The dentists are clearly of a higher standard and I doubt you could find a similar level of ability in England. </p>
      <p>I paid around &pound;5300 (mainly because of the cosmetic work which Fedasz told me I didn't really need, but I wanted anyway). In England I would have received little change from &pound;20000 for what I had done. I was never in pain and would recommend Fedasz to anyone. </p>
      <p>Budapest is now a modern, Westernised city. It is safe to travel around, unaccompanied and has all the facilities you would want (everything is obviously less-expensive, though). The return flight cost me under &pound;100 from Luton and I was met at the airport in Budapest by a Fedasz representative. The hotel was very clean and modern with friendly staff. You meet other guests who have come for dental work at Fedasz, many of whom have horror-stories about expensive, painful and unsuccessful work they had done in England and other countries.</p></td>
