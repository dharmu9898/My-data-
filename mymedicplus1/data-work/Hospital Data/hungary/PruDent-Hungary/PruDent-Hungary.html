        The Zoom2 system is the most up to date and advanced teeth whitening system,  where UV light is used in order to make your teeth whiter. <br />
        It is the safest, fastest and most effective way and it is to be performed  by a dental professional. With the Zoom2 cosmetic dental treatment the shade of  your teeth can be an average 8 grades lighter - in just one hour!<br />
        Extensive research and clinical studies indicate that whitening teeth under  the supervision of a dentist is totally safe and is causing no harm or damages  in the teeth.<br />
        The treatment takes about 30+45=75 minutes. After the approx  30 minutes preparation time there is the special UV light treatment for 3x15  minutes. During the treatment you can just lay back to relax, or listen to your  favourite music.</p>

    <td><p>Finally I have the smile I never had. Dr. Szeder is a detail minded professional which shows in the way he first determines the work needed to be done and most importantly in the sessions of treatment for which is worth traveling to this town for.

        The service was excellent and the staff were so helpful and our whole experience was positive one at PruDent. Maybe a few short footnote to advise visitors of the railway station - maybe take a short note in Hungarian to the ticket counter when buying your ticket. There are good restaurants to go to and good places to shop. I would recommend this service to anyone! It was so well taken care of and efficient. Everone was very kind and you felt taken care of from the minute you arrived. Very pleased! <br />

        My experience at PruDent was excellent. I was extremely impressed with Christa's professionalism and responsiveness when I initially inquired about PruDent. When I arrived in Hungary I appreciated not only how accommodating all of the staff were but also the effort taken to ensure that I was comfortable and that all of my concerns were addressed. I really felt that I was being properly &quot;looked after&quot; during my entire stay in Mosonmagyar&oacute;v&aacute;r. Most importantly I was extremely satisfied with the dental work that I had done. Dr. Szeder was by far the most meticulous and thorough dentist I have ever been treated by. Both Dr. Szeder and Ildiko were efficient, attentive and gentle. I am so pleased with the results and would be more than happy to have potential patients contact me to recount my experience.<br />
