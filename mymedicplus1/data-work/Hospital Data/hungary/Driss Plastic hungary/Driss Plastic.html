      <p>Groningen Clinic (Netherlands) <br />
        The UMCG is the only university medical center in the northern part of the Netherlands, and therefore the final point of referral for many patients. </p>
      <p>The UMCG architectures sets it apart from other hospitals, Construction began in 1983 and is still ongoing. Each of the outpatients' clinics was designed by a different interior decorator. Each outpatient's clinic has its own image and unique identity. The building itself does not dominate or overwhelm, but instead empowers the patients who visit it and the people who work there. This makes the UMCG one of the finest state-of-the-art hospitals of Europe. </p>
      <p>The more than 8500 employees and 1300 beds make the UMCG one of the largest hospitals in The Netherlands. It is sometimes called &#145;a city inside a city', because of the architecture, with covered streets that lead to the nursing units and outpatients clinics. There are shops, a branch of one of the national banks, gardens, as well as lunchrooms, in order to make patients less aware that they are in a hospital. This philosophy has led to a hospital that is unique in Europe.</p>
      <p>the UMCG has a wider area of responsibilities than regular hospitals. First of all, the UMCG is a final point of referral care is for patients suffering from rare or complicated diseases which are hard to diagnose and/or difficult to treat. Next to that, the UMCG is an educational institution and a center of research. The UMCG offers master and bachelor courses for medical students. Moreover, it also trains doctors who want to specialize in a particular field of medicine. Last but not least, the UMCG offers basic and advanced courses for nurses.</p>
      <p>Patients go to the UMCG for basic care as well as highly specialist top clinical and top reference care, such as organ transplants, complex neuro-surgery, neonatology, clinical genetics, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), pediatric oncology, renal dialysis, traumatology and Plastic Surgery. All medical specialties are represented, as well as education programs for all medical disciplines. The final assessment of the specific disorder a patient is suffering from, is usually a matter of research!</p>
      <p>The UMCG is one of the very few hospitals worldwide that perform all organ transplants. This does not only concern kidney, heart, lung, liver, and small bowel transplants, but also combined organ transplants, such as heart-lung, lung-liver, and liver-kidney transplants. The UMCG annually performs over 150 organ transplants. Apart from organ transplants, also skin, thin bowel, heart valve, cornea, bone and bone marrow transplants are carried out. The UMCG is one of ten recognized trauma centers in The Netherlands. It has all the necessary specialties and facilities, has its own trauma helicopter.</p>
