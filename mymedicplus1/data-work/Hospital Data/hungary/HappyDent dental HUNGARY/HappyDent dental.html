    <p><strong>Presentation </strong><br />
      Beautiful smile, healthy and treated teeth, a good look! All these in a painless way, in a comfortable environment, meeting every requirement. Our most important guidelines are the interest and satisfaction of our patients. <br />
      </p>
    <p><strong>Welcome to our homepage! </strong><br />
      My name is Dr. J&aacute;nos Lehoczky, I received my diploma as a dental technician in 1987, later I graduated from the Faculty of Dentistry of Albert Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Medical School in 1993. I passed a special examination in dental and mouth diseases in 1995, then I took a special EU accredited examination in Conserving Dentistry and Prosthetics. </p>
<p>My dental technician diploma is for the interest of our patients, too, since I can follow the stages of preparing replacements step by step as a dental technician, and also as a dentist. In our dental surgery we have been offering implanting implants (artificial roots) from 1995, making possible by this service for our future patients to carry out fixed replacements firmly integrated into jaw, even if patient is missing several teeth or all of his/her teeth. We offer a wide range of services, from the simplest tooth extraction to implanting a root implant.</p>
    <p>We use the latest machines, devices and materials so as to treat your problem. We fix appointments with patients, thus waiting period is minimal. So as to improve my professional skills, I participate in several in-service courses and workshops in Dentistry every year. My dental surgery has become a training dental surgery of Medical Scool of Szeged, taking part in training students of Dentistry continuously. Thank you for your interest, if you have any questions, you can consult us, we hope to see you soon, quotations are made free.</p></td>
