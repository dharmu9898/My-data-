To keep in line with the technical development, Aesthetica works with a special diode laser appliance, which has been commonly used abroad for years, but in our country it is almost unknown. Thanks to the modern technology, in the course of the treatment the hair follicles are consumed, and they will not grow any more in the future. In this sense the effect of the treatment is permanent. </p>
