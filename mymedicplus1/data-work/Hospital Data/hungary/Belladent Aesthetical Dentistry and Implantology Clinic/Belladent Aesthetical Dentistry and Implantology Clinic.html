    <p"><strong>Crowns </strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>Category: Prosthodontics (Crowns, Bridges, Implants)</p>
    <p>Crowns are an ideal way to rebuild teeth which have been broken, or have been weakened by decay or a very large filling. The crown fits right over the remaining part of the tooth, making it strong and giving it.</p>
    <p><strong>Dental Implants</strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>Category: Prosthodontics (Crowns, Bridges, Implants)</p>
    <p>Dental implants are the permanent way for you to replace your missing teeth. Research and documentation show long-lasting results. Hundreds of thousands of people are now enjoying their new looks and their ability.</p>
    <p><strong>Implants </strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>Category: General Dentistry</p>
    <p>Implantology: a dental implant is an artificial tooth root replacement and is used in prosthetic dentistry to support restorations that resemble a tooth or group of teeth. The biggest advantage of implants is that we don&rsquo;t need to prepare the healthy (neighbor) teeth for a bridge. In our clinic we use the following implant systems: Nobel Biocare Replace (www.nobelbiocare.com), Ankylos (www.dentsply-friadent.com) and Pitt-Easy (http://www.oraltronics.org).<br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Veneer </strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>Category: General Dentistry</p>
    <p>Veneer: Treatment and duration time: </p>
    <p>A veneer is a thin layer of porcelain made to fit over the front surface of a tooth, like a false fingernail fits over a nail. Sometimes a natural colour</p>
    <p><strong>dental implants, all ceramic crowns, veneeres and bridges</strong><br />
    </p>
    <p>Category: Prosthodontics (Crowns, Bridges, Implants)</p>
    <p>Implantology is the most advanced method available for restoring tooth loss. We employ three different implant systems in our practice: Nobel-Biocare, Sky Implants and Alpha-Bio. The types of implants we use are tailored individually to the needs of each patient. <br />
