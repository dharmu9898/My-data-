    <p><strong>About Us and Our Clinic</strong><br />
      Oswald Andra-Dent&rsquo;s surgeries have welcomed patients from all over Europe since 1990 and are continuously modernised to meet current standards and practices of dentistry. </p>
    <p>In bright and friendly surgeries, modern equipment such as computerized and panoramic x-ray machines and state-of-theart dentist&rsquo;s chairs help create a relaxing atmosphere wherepatients are not anxious. During a thorough preliminary consultation with one of our English-speaking dentists, the patient receives and discusses all the information about the available treatment options and the costs that would be involved. </p>
    <p>Collaborating with 25 qualified dental technicians, we use top quality materials: high-carat-gold, remanium and ceramic. We create shatter-proof prosthetics that are worn with total comfort and ease. </p>
    <p>Following their scholastic education, all the dentists in this surgery have absolved a 5-year degree course at the Hungarian University and then completed their training by assisting a dentist for 3 years. All our dentists hold a doctorate.</p>
    <p>A member of our staff is a jaw surgeon, who is responsible for dental implantology and any other operations on the jaw such as building up the bone. Having successfully undertaken more than 1000 implants, he is considered to be at the forefront of his field in Hungary. In addition to the excellent and friendly dental treatment Oswald Andra-Dent practices provide using the English language, they also ensure that your leisure time in Hungary becomes an unforgettable experience. </p>
    <p>Agi, our tourist guide, spares no effort to ensure the well-being of our guests whilst in Hungary. She organizes visits to Budapest, to monasteries and museums as well as beautiful walks in the countryside and boat trips in the natural and romantic Raba region. You can enjoy our fountain of youth, the iodine-rich thermal spa, either together with other group members or on your own. Or you may wish to book a foot or a body massage, or indulge in treatment using a variety of mud packs.</p>

      <br />
      &bdquo;Stayed a week in Gyor &ndash; nice and quiet town. People are friendly, everything was perfectly organized. Excellent, painless work, up-to-date equipments. The dentists and the assistant are excellent, and the travel assistant, Agnes is very helpful and nice, always there when I needed her. Thanks for everything!&rdquo; <br />

    <p>&bdquo;From the moment I landed to the moment I left I knew I was in safe hands, Oswald-Andra Dent make every effort to ensure that your treatment in Hungary is a good experience and I was peasantly surprised by their level of professionalism and the standard of the dentistry. You are taken by taxi to and from the surgery although it is only a short and pleasant walk across the river from the town centre and despite their 50 patients a week, the dentist and his team are always prepared and ready to see you when you arrive. </p>
    <p>Oswald-Andra Dent are very keen to make sure that you get the right treatment and help you pick the best option avilable, the dentists are excellent, even the injections were painless! The surgery is state of art and very efficient knocking spots of any English surgery I have seen. I was in Gy&ouml;r for one week and thanks to the itinerary of free daily trips and evening restaurant trips I managed to have myself a holiday at the same time. Gy&ouml;r is a pretty town with a lot of history, there are two markets held every week, the local restaurants are very good and serve a wide variety of surprisingly food at ridiculously low prices, they even have special &bdquo;soft&rdquo; menus for dental patients. </p>
    <p>All in all this is an excellent deal for the money I saved enough money one one necessary bridge here in England to afford to have the rest of my top row crowned and my bottom set whitened and still spent &#8356; 6,000 less than the dentist here had quoted for the one bridge. In the future I will always return to Gy&ouml;r for any major dental work and save London for the hygienist only. </p>
    <p>If you are toying with the idea of dental tourism, I strongly recommend you get yourself a Hungaian smile, I love mine.&rdquo; <br />
