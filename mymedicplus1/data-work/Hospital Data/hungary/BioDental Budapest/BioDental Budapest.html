    <td><p><strong>Welcome to Bio Dental Budapest</strong></p>
      <p>BioDental Budapest is the dentistry you can trust. We are committed to Quality, Value and Service. We are proud of the way we care for you and the professional dental service we offer.<br />
        Thank you very much for coming to see us &ndash; we are taking a fresh approach to dental treatment in Budapest, Hungary &ndash; this site is designed to help you make the decision to get in touch with us to discuss your needs &ndash; we have tried to put you, the patient, at the heart of the site so you can make an informed decision to contact us without being overwhelmed with information &ndash; we hope you do, if you do, you will &ndash; feel the difference!</p>
      <p>If you're looking for implants, traditional or cosmetic dentistry such as dental implants, crowns, bridges, veneers, tooth whitening, filling change or root canal treatments that are not only cheap, but best quality you are at the right place. You can have outstanding quality dental treatment and save money at the same time.    </p>
      <p><strong>&quot;I had treatment just in time&rdquo;. </strong></p>
      <p>My name is Andrew, I am 47 years old and I have always had problem teeth. I was not blessed with the whitest teeth and I was very prone to cavities as a child. These were filled with amalgam which I had carried with me all my life &ndash; it had become unsightly and damaged and I was conscious of it when I laughed and smiled.</p>
      <p>Even more significantly my gums were causing me problems &ndash; they were bleeding a lot when I brushed my teeth and some of my closest friends had been brave enough to tell me that my breath was not always too sweet.</p>
      <p>I had had two teeth extracted and the gaps had been simply left. I had never received any advice on what the options were following the extractions.</p>
      <p>I knew I had neglected my teeth and I was not a big fan of visiting the dentist, I needed to do something &ndash; I take care of myself in other ways &ndash; regular exercise, healthy diet etc. </p>
      <p>I was lucky enough to meet Dr Horvath and to learn about his dental practice and dental standards in Hungary. He examined me and without hesitation I accepted his offer of treatment - I was mortified to learn that my gums and teeth were in such bad shape.</p>
      <p>I had extensive treatment with him and his team over a five day period. All the staff were very kind and helpful and they went to extreme lengths to avoid causing me any pain.</p>
      <p>I cannot praise them highly enough &ndash; most importantly my gums no longer bleed and my teeth are clean and bright with no unsightly amalgam. My personal desire was not the ultra-bright &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; smile but a healthy and clean set of teeth and gums.</p>
      <p>My gum problem was so severe that two teeth had to be removed as a result of periodontitis (erosion of the jaw bone caused by deep infection in the pocket between the gum and the tooth) &ndash; I am returning to Hungary later this year for implant surgery which will complete my treatment.</p>
      <p>I have saved thousands of pounds but, of equal importance, I was treated with respect in an unhurried yet professional manner. The work I had done would have involved numerous visits in the UK, countless interruptions to my work schedule and time off. </p>
      <p>I have traveled extensively and lived overseas for much of my life &ndash; this was my best dental experience by far.</p>

        &quot;The trip and apartment were fantastic and what can I say about the teeth<br />
        ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC&quot; <br />
        &quot;It has changed me and my life in so many ways and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for the opportunity for this experience.&quot;<br />
        Bibby</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;I would not hesitate in returning to Budapest&quot;<br />
        &quot;The trip itself was absolutely wonderful. The apartment was absolutely gorgeous and the views across the Danube were spectacular. In relation to the care and service BioDental offers, it surpassed all expectations and I have nothing but praise for all of the staff. </p>
      <p>Christina scaled and polished my teeth to the highest standard - easily on par with dentistry in America which I have experienced.  She was an absolute delight and I was impressed with her warm but professional approach throughout.</p>
      <p>I would ask you to personally thank Dr. Horvath for his kind hospitality and generosity shown to me. I would not hesitate in returning to Budapest.&quot;<br />
        SC</p>
      <p>&quot;Biodental encompasses all that a patient could want in a truly fantastic team of dedicated dentists that I can only recommend with the highest regard.&quot; </p>
      <p>They are dedicated, scrupulously clean and take huge pride in what they do.  This is exemplified in the highest standard of technical expertise together with a certain artistry when achieving a final natural looking finish. </p>
      <p>My story was a nightmare of gum disease and loose teeth, which led to abscesses on a weekly basis.  I was eating penicillin tablets like they were sweeties, trying hard not to think about the possibility of having to wear dentures. What Dr Horvath has achieved with me is quite remarkable.  So far, I have had nine extractions, bone augmentation plus implants upper and lower.   We are talking major work yet I did not suffer any pain!  To be honest, I thought I would lose at least a stone in weight, but I actually gained a 1lb while I was in Budapest because I was able to eat the next day.  The staff are professional yet really friendly and they seem to know exactly how a patient feels; especially those of us coming from abroad and feeling a little bit lost and extremely nervous. </p>
      <p>Like you, I did a lot of research before embarking on this treatment, but am convinced that I chose wisely.  When considering the many horror dental stories that abound in our popular press, the flip-side is that one can only be impressed with the quiet professionalism evident in this clinic.  The team work unhurriedly until they (and you) are totally satisfied with the result during each stage of the treatment.   I am returning to Budapest in February for a sinus lift (bone augmentation) prior to the final implants being placed in the upper jaw.  I will then go back later in 2008 for what I describe as &quot;my ten years younger look&quot; - the permanent teeth. <br />
        I could not have afforded this dental work in the UK and am therefore truly thankful that Dr Horvath could give me back my smile at a realistically priced alternative.</p>
      <p>There are other pluses:  The clinic provides a driver at the airport who speaks English; a beautiful apartment overlooking the Chain Bridge and the Castle, and close to the shopping area and restaurants (optional but highly recommended).   A phone is provided, so that you can call the team's liaison person at any time during your stay.  For me, these touches were significant as one cannot put a price on those extra comforts. <br />

      <p> <strong>&quot;Testimonials 2 </strong><br />
        We were both treated with the utmost kindness, sympathy, professionalism, and respect.&quot;<br />
        &quot;All went very well, although it went &quot;right down to the wire&quot;. The final session with Dr Horvath ending at about 10.30 or after on Monday evening! I understand all the reasons though, so please don't think the comment is intended as a criticism. <br />
        All the while, we were both treated with the utmost kindness, sympathy, professionalism, and respect. The quality of workmanship too was all that I could have hoped for.<br />
      I am very pleased with the outcome and have absolutely no discomfort at all - far better than own teeth ever were! I found the whole experience fascinating and the Hungarian people lovely. It is my understanding that Hungary is considered by many to be the dental capital of Europe. Most of the dentists are apparently trained in Germany. I did quite a lot of research on the net and it came down to a choice between 2 in Budapest. In the end what made my mind up was the fact that BioDental had an English representative Andrew Bones. Andrew could not have been more patient, knowledgeable and helpful, and personally I found that quite reassuring.</p>
      <p>Once my mind was made up, Andrew took over and made all the necessary arrangements in Hungary. We were there within about 2 weeks. He arranged for us to be collected by taxi at the airport (which they paid for), and taken to the apartment (100m from the houses of parliament and overlooking the Danube). There we were once again met and taken inside, where all the basics were explained to us. We were even left 2 mobile phones which already had contact numbers programmed in, and with credit! We found the apartment to be more than adequate and in a wonderful central location, and for this we were charged &pound;40/night. We were on about the 5/6 floor (I can't remember which) and the view from the windows was stunning. And, if you wanted a bath you had run the water for 20 minutes before it came hot! To be honest this really just added to the charm of the place as far as we were concerned.</p>
      <p>Next day a taxi was sent to collect us at a pre-arranged time, to take us to the clinic. There all the staff lined up to meet us, introduce themselves and shake hands. We then spent an hour in separate surgeries whilst they cleaned and polished our teeth &quot;free of charge&quot;! Christine, one of the young dentists then drove us in her car to a clinic where they took a full CAT scan of my upper and lower jaws, got the results, then took us back to the surgery. </p>
      <p>There then followed a lengthy delay whilst they discussed the state of my teeth and jaw and the various options open to them/me. I was then called back in so that they could discuss and explain to me why I couldn't have implants as I had originally planned, and what it was they were proposing to do. They then gave me a written quotation. It was only at this point that I committed myself - up until then I would have been free to go home, only having to pay for the CAT scan and accommodation so far. </p>
      <p>As a Buyer for the last 28 years I can tell you that the contract I signed was one of the simplest, most straightforward and transparent I have seen. Because the nature of the work was so complicated we spent most of the next nine days in the surgery - 43hrs in total! In all that time they were kindness itself and extremely gentle. They even provided us with food and drink whilst we were there (not that I could eat much!). They removed my old 6 tooth bridge which had started to fall apart, removed a wisdom tooth, cut off some roots, then took out other roots with abscesses on etc. etc. They then made me a temporary plate and set about preparing posts to support the bridges which they were going to fix. A full bridge around the upper deck and other bridges at either side at the bottom. I can honestly say that in all that time I was never in much pain. The original plan had been to stay in Hungary for 7 days, but in the end we had to stay for another 2 days.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&quot;We found Budapest to be a beautiful and fascinating city and have already decided that at some point we want to return. Andrew says that when we want to go we will be able to rent the apartment again - subject to availability of course! I found the whole experience fascinating and the Hungarian people lovely. We felt totally safe walking about Budapest both by night and day. The treatment we received was in all respects far and away better than anything you would ever dream of receiving in this country.&quot;<br />

      <p>&quot;I have ignored my teeth for far too long. Despite sensible dental checks many years ago, for some reason - and I am at a loss to give a good excuse.<br />
        I stopped seeing a proper dentist. Several molars had been extracted professionally, and some had left of their own accord. Gaps existed, and a few of the remaining molars were rotting nicely. </p>
      <p>The more the state of my mouth deteriorated, the more I felt unable to show this mess to a professional for fear of censure. Plainly ridiculous this state of affairs had to be reversed, but I was fearful of the cost required to get back to a respectable state. Where to begin? </p>
      <p>What ever Dr Horvath and his team first thought on glimpsing the enormity of the task that lay ahead, they kindly kept to themselves. A plan was quickly drawn up, and work began. Back home from my first visit, I'm wearing part of a bone graft, loaded with five titanium implant abutments and tidied with eight new fillings. The programme is coming on nicely. More work to go; two more trips, five more implants and many crowns before the project is completed. </p>
      <p>At no time was anything painful. Sometimes a little uncomfortable, but never painful. The team sharing the work load were quite fantastic. They are all the loveliest crowd I've had the pleasure to meet. I mean t it when I said to them on leaving, that I will miss them all terribly. I genuinely look forward to going back and continuing the make over. </p>
      <p>If anyone had second thoughts about entrusting their dental condition to this team, I would urge them to go immediately, put their inhibitions and groundless fears to one side. I am the biggest coward imaginable but found nothing of concern. Instead enjoy meeting the most professional team, in a lavishly equipped clinic at one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I am excited and thrilled at last, to be sorting out something that has been staring me in the face every day. I wish I'd met these people years ago. </p>
      <p>The one week travel card, combined with the reliable train and tram network, which runs quite late at night, made moving around the city a doddle and a joy. <br />
        &#65279;I have tried to examine my decision making process Andrew, and should tell you that your closest competitor was Hungarian Dental Travel. I drew great comfort from their photo gallery of horrors. It's a good site, but the fact that most of their clinics were outside of Budapest, and the number of them, persuaded me to Biodental's more intimate arrangements. </p>
      <p>No other website came close to seeming appropriate for me. Early on I had spotted that many of the sites are representing dozens of clinics, and I preferred the idea of a single dedicated team. Anything with links to Harley Street, or pre-travel assessment I left to one side. </p>
      <p>Cost was not a factor other than the widespread knowledge that it would be less than the UK. I had no idea how much would need to be done, and even genuinely considered that the good doctor might take one look and say &quot;on your bike, you're too far gone&quot;. I guessed that at least six implants would be useful, and had mentally apportioned 20k to the whole operation. I've had many dental cost-free years to this point after all. </p>
      <p>The excellence of all of the Hungarian dentists was not in doubt, and my three previous visits to Hungary had all left a very favourable impression of both the people and the country. Lake Balaton is very lovely but I thought for this operation the big city would be my preferred choice. </p>
      <p>The wording and design of your website comes over as very honest and sincere, but I do go back to your own diary as the biggest single clincher. In you r case, and even more in mine; neglect, decay and embarrassment in equal measure, and a fear - not of the treatment - but of censure. </p>
      <p>Meeting the team is a revelation; the women the good doctor has surrounded himself with are real stars. You'd said I would know when Kristina entered the hotel foyer, and without question the whole place brightened up as she walked in. </p>
      <p>Also I must thank Miklos (and his knee) for his painstaking trouble. I didn't bother him while I was staying, but it was very reassuring to know he was on the end of your phone if trouble struck.&rdquo;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Testimonials 3 </strong><br />
      &quot;This was truly one of the best investments I have ever made&quot;.</p>
      <p>I want to thank you both very much for making a significant contribution to what has been a superb dental experience. You provided a vital resource for information and then organisation of my dental visit.</p>
      <p>I also want to thank Dr Horvath and his entire team for my new teeth. The way in which he and his team have treated me has really touched me.<br />
        I felt that his practise is very unique in its team work approach, professional expertise and kindness. <br />
        With my porcelain veneers Biodental Budapest have transformed my teeth and my smile. This was truly one of the best investments I have ever made. <br />
        Thank you so much <br />

        I am very happy I found Dr Horvath and BioDental Budapest. At last here is a doctor who takes care of my gums as well! Before my gums were countinously inflamed and bled heavily when I brushed my teeth. I spent long time with brushing and cleaning my teeth but I still had bad breath.Dr Horv&aacute;th showed me the reason. It was because of my bad bridges. Dr Horvath and his team fixed everything. All my problems are in the past. I am very satisfied.<br />
      MK Beautician</p>
      <p>Fantastic! I have seen lots of dentists but I have never found such thoroughness and precision! Dr Horv&aacute;th and his team pay extraordinary attention to detail. Of course the good work needs more time, and the treatments were longer than I used to have with other dentists. But I do not mind it at all because the final reault speaks for itself! Their work lasts almost a lifetime. Fillings do not need to be changed every few years. Thank you BioDental Budapest. <br />
        GK Businessman</p>
      <p>I had a bad tooth that was root canal treated many times but I still had a pain. I was really afraid of the dentist, I went to see one who wanted to pull out the problem tooth. I did not allow him to do this. I had heard about BioDental Budapest from my colleague. He highly recommended them to me because they can treat the most frightened patient! I was welcomed by a very kind team. The assistants were continually taking care of me, never left me alone. Dr G&aacute;sp&aacute;r examined my tooth and made an X-ray. She explaned to me in detail what was going on in my tooth, what caused the inflammation and what to do. She said the root canal cleaning can treat my tooth with 90% effectivness. No need to have it extracted. I was very happy with this news because I did not want to have any gaps in my teeth. The root canal cleaning was absolutely painless! I asked for a pain killer but was informed it was not necessary. Because I was afraid of the injection I agreed, but I asked her to give me anaesthetic if I felt pain. I did not need it! Unbelievable! My tooth is completely restored, I have a beautiful porcelain inlay. My friends can not tell which of my teeth is artificial. Thank you very much for Biodental Budapest.</p></td>
