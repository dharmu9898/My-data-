    <td><strong>The European Institute of Oncology</strong> was established to implement an innovative model for health and advanced research in the international oncology field. Its Division and Unit Directors come from eight European countries.<br />
      <br />
    Conceived by Umberto Veronesi and inaugurated in May 1994, the Institute became a research hospital and treatment centre (IRCCS or &ldquo;Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico&rdquo;) through the Ministerial Decree issued in January 1996. The European Institute of Oncology adopts the non-profit private-law organisation model and provides services through agreements with Italy&rsquo;s National Health Service. </td>
