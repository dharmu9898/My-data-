    <td><p>There is nowhere else quite like the Hospital of St John &amp; St Elizabeth, or &ldquo;John and Lizzie&rsquo;s&rdquo; as it is affectionately known. Established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1856 &ldquo;to help the sick, the dying and the needy&rdquo; it is today one of the largest independent hospitals in the country. But true to its founding principles it is also a registered charity which uses its profits to provide free care and support for people with terminal illnesses such as cancer, HIV/AIDS and motor neurone disease.</p>
      <p>John and Lizzie&rsquo;s is a world-class hospital, and people come from all over the world to be treated here. But it is also a local hospital for local people, much-loved by those who use it. At its centre is the St John&rsquo;s Hospice which every year cares for over 600 terminally-ill people from central and north-west London, Surrey and Kent.</p>
      <p>Both the hospital and the hospice take great pride in their heritage, and especially in the charitable ethos on which they were founded. The aim of both institutions is the same now as it was 150 years ago &mdash; to provide the highest quality health care for all those who seek it.</p></td>

    <td><p>Accreditation</p>
      <p>Healthcare Commission logoEvery consultant who works at John and Lizzie&rsquo;s is audited in line with the requirements of the Healthcare Commission. They must be on the appropriate specialist register and hold (or have held) a substantive NHS consultant post. In all cases, we verify their qualifications, sub-specifications and medical insurance. In addition, all staff employed by the hospital undergo qualifications and criminal record checks every two years.</p>
      <p>The hospital itself is registered and inspected by the Healthcare Commission. The pathology services are accredited by the widely respected Clinical Pathology Accreditation Ltd, and the surgical units for colorectal cancer and breast cancer are approved by BUPA.</p>
    <p>There are always at least 13 members of staff on site with advanced life support training for adults, and 10 members of staff with advanced life support training for children &mdash; this is a very high level of cover. (Advanced life support training is the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for doctors and nurses to manage the early stages of a medical emergency.)</p></td>
