    <td><p>The <strong>Cancer Institute NSW </strong>was established in July 2003 through the Cancer Institute NSW Act 2003 as a response to the need to further decrease the devastating impact of cancer on our society.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Cancer Institute NSW </strong>is charged with substantially improving cancer control in NSW. This will be achieved by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>  reducing the incidence of cancer in NSW;<br />
          </li>
        <li>increasing the survival rate for people diagnosed with cancer;<br />
          </li>
        <li>improving the quality of life for cancer patients and their carers; and<br />
          </li>
        <li>become a source of expertise on cancer and provide expert advice to patients, the public, health care professionals and the Government.</li>
      </ul>      
      <p>The state&rsquo;s first cancer plan covered the period 2004-2006 and was developed in consultation with NSW Department of Health and other key stakeholders to build on and enhance the valuable work already in progress in this State</p></td>

    <td><p><strong>Accreditation of NSW Cancer Services</strong></p>
      <p>The Development of an Accreditation Program for NSW Cancer Services</p>
      <p>The development of a Cancer Services Accreditation Program to review and accredit cancer services throughout NSW is one of the goals identified in the 2007-2010 Cancer Plan. It is envisaged that the cancer accreditation program will underpin current accreditation activities already undertaken by cancer services. It aims to achieve this by limiting the focus to the quality and safety arrangements of clinical cancer care.</p>
      <p>The Cancer Services Accreditation Program involves the development of both an accreditation model and the standards to underpin this model. The development of these elements of the program is being undertaken by the consultant group Communio and will include extensive consultation from key stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Three background documents on the development of the NSW cancer services accreditation program have been prepared:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>  Literature Review on Standards Development and Accreditation <br />
        </li>
        <li>Principles of Accreditation </li>
