      <p>I have had a very pleasant stay at San Jos&eacute; Hospital.The doctors and staff have been very efficient and professional.I feel comfortable when I am with a bilingual speaking staff member. I know they are familiar with the area/hospital and at the same time can communicate with me.This makes me feel safe.</p>

      City of residency: Loma Linda, CA., USA</strong></p>
      <p>During my wife&acute;s 9 &ndash;day stay, we were treated very well by the doctors, nurses and staff of the hospital. Dr. Fernando Cant&uacute; Flores, in particular, is an outstanding physician. The facilities were kept clean and comfortable; food was delivered promptly; and the details of nursing care-including daily showers- exceeded that of our expectations. Thank you for a very good experience.</p>

      <p>My stay at your hospital was superb. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The language barrier was no problem because of the information we were given to translate common sayings or request. My daughter, who is a RN in the states came with me and she was very impressed with the quality of service from the hospital staff and doctors. My room was extremely clean, large and pretty. We were treated with the utmost respect and comfort. I have nothing but good things to report about my treatment at your hospital. I would recommend the doctors and your hospital to anyone and have many times since my stay. I was treated the way people should be treated when they are in a hospital and I have not had that before or since I returned from Mexico. Thank you for the respect and sincere concern I received while in your care.</p>
