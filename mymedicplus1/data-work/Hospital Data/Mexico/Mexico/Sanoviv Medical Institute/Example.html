        Biological  Immune Stimulators And Modulators</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Orthomolecular Supplementation</strong><br />
      The key idea in orthomolecular medicine is that genetic factors affect not only the physical characteristics of individuals, but also to their biochemical milieu. Biochemical pathways of the body have significant genetic variability and diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, schizophrenia or depression are associated with specific biochemical abnormalities which are causal or contributing factors of the illness.</p>

      <p>Colon Therapy (up to 3 times per week) <br />
        Coffee Enemas. <br />
        Wheat Grass Implants.<br />
        Oxygen Therapy<br />
        Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (up to 12 sessions), It is well documented that HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment) helps heal damaged tissue from radiation or chemotherapy in cancer patients.<br />
        Cancer cannot live in highly oxygenated environment, thus the use of HBOT is highly effective for such treatment because it increases the amount of oxygen in your body.</p>
      <p><strong>Hyperthermia</strong><br />
      Hyperthermia (also called thermal therapy or thermotherapy) is a type of cancer treatment in which body tissue is exposed to high temperatures (up to 113&not;?F). Research has shown that high temperatures can damage and kill cancer cells, usually with minimal injury to normal tissues. By killing cancer cells and damaging proteins and structures within cells, hyperthermia may shrink tumors.</p>
      <p><strong>Bioenergetic Treatments</strong><br />
      This will be greatly based on your specific condition. Different treatment schemes will be used to control pain, this will help your body position your body for healing while controlling pain, etc. These are non-invasive therapies that work with the energy meridians of your body.</p>
      <p><strong>Ultra Violet Blood Irrigation Therapy</strong><br />
        Small amounts of your blood are passed through a sterile apparatus that is infused with Ultra-Violet light. This process causes oxidation of toxins and kills pathogenic organism in the blood, which is then re-introduced through an intravenous line. It is a powerful tool for cleansing the blood and reducing strain on the healing mechanism of the body.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Matrix Regeneration Therapy</strong><br />
      This is a tailored detoxification treatment that focuses on the soft connective tissue that acts as a conduit to the cells of every organ in the body. This connective tissue provides access to the lymphatic and circulatory systems, transporting nutrients to the cells and disposing of waste products. Establishing normal function and connective tissue is a vital step in healing the body.</p>
      <p><strong>Dental Program</strong><br />
      Based on the results of your dental evaluation, your dentists and doctors may recommend removal of your amalgam fillings or handing of other dental work that is compromising your health.</p>
