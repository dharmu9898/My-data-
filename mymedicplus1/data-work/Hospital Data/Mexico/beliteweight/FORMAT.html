      <p>In 2001 at the age of 45 I knew I had to do something about my weight or I wouldn't live to be 50. I had high blood pressure, I had just been diagnosed as type II diabetic, I had no cartilage in either of my knees and was in constant chronic pain. It was difficult for me to walk short distances; I could not even tie my own shoes or shave my own legs. I had been obese to morbidly obese for over 20 years, gaining and losing weight while having 3 children in my 20's and all the diets in-between including Opti-fast, Weight-Watchers, Nutri-system, Phen-phen, etc. I was able to lose weight as I was a professional dieter, my problem was maintaining. I always ended up gaining the weight back, plus more. </p>
      <p>I have now lost over 100 pounds since my highest weight, had total knee replacement surgery in my right knee last year and my life is completely different! I am healthier now than I have ever been and can keep up with my 7 year old granddaughter. I have gone from a size 3X-4X to size 16. I have been banded 4 1/2 years now and I would do this again in a heartbeat! I am grateful every day for the Lap Band surgery giving me my life back! </p>
      <p>Thank you,<br />
      Debra</p>

      <p>&quot;Have been struggling with my weight for several years, Then I started researching different ways to lose. I checked Into the Gastric Bypass, and other different ways and I have been on every &quot;diet&quot; in the book. Well, I read and read about the Lap Band in Mexico and I finally decided to go for it, I got in touch with a nice lady, Terri Frost who was with Beliteweight and she helped me soooo much! So my sweet brother drove his wife and me down there. She and I both had the surgery. My top weight was 330 pounds I'm down both pounds and inches. I feel great! Best thing I ever did for myself. Thanks to Lap Band I can now lose the weight and I fee so much better! I still have a ways to go but im on my way! Thanks to Lap Band!&quot;</p>
      <p>Greatfully,<br />
