    <td><p><strong>HeartScan International </strong>offers a wide range of medical check-up programs designed to check the health status of each individual based on his or her age requirements. The programs are efficiently and professionally run in a well organized manner with the patient&rsquo;s convenience in mind.</p>
      <p>The programs are regularly updated with the latest in technology.&nbsp;Our medical check-up programs incorporate the plaque detector scan&nbsp;for detection of coronary atherosclerosis and the high resolution low dose lung scan. The e-Speed is a highly sensitive non-invasive scanner for the detection of early heart disease and lung cancer.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>KeyFeatures </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Incorporates the plaque detector scan using the ultrafast e-Speed scanner <br />
        </li>
        <li>A high resolution low dose lung EBCT scan is much more accurate than simple chest Xray for detecting lung cancer and other thoracic diseases.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Gastrovideoscopy for&nbsp;diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal pathology.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Diagnostic results ready within 3&nbsp;hours <br />
          The patient will have his health status explained by the doctor on the same day. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Prior appointment at least 1 week in advance is advised&nbsp;for appointment scheduling so as to minimize on patient waiting time and inconvenience</p>

    <td><p>OUR MISSION<br />
      HeartScan International is one of the very few diagnostic centers in the world using the ultrafast, low radiation&nbsp;e-Speed EBCT scanner for cardiac and body imaging.</p>
      <p>At the blazing speed of 30 images per second,&nbsp;the e-Speed is undoubtedly the world's fastest CT scanner.&nbsp;e-Speed has a true scan speed of&nbsp;33 msec per slice which is 10 times faster than the true scan speed of even the latest 64 slice CT.&nbsp;This speed advantage ensures consistent and accurate imaging of the beating heart without the need for medications to slow down the heart beat.&nbsp;A diagnostic image set is obtained in every patient even when the heart beat is irregular.&nbsp;In the case of 64 slice CT, due to its slower scan speed, it is necessary to slow down the patient's heart rate to below 60 beats per minute before a proper scan&nbsp;can be performed.&nbsp;This is achieved by administering high dose beta blockers which is time consuming and which can be dangerous in patients with weak hearts.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Radiation dosage is another important issue.&nbsp;The e-Speed delivers 10 times lower X -ray radiation dose compared to 64 slice CT.&nbsp;With the advent of 128 or 256 slice CT scanners, the amount of cancer&nbsp;causing radiation given to the patient is even much higher. It is unethical to subject a patient to unnecessary radiation when the same accurate test can be performed with a scanner which gives very low radiation.</p>
      <p>EBCT is still the gold standard for coronary artery calcium scanning.&nbsp;Almost all scientific validation and clinical studies to date on coronary artery calcium scanning have been performed using EBCT and these results do not necessarily apply to multislice CT which is a different technology. It is possible to perform coronary artery calcium scanning with 64 slice CT but it is necessary to give beta blockers to slow down the heart to below 60 beats per minute before the scan is performed in order to obtain an accurate score. Many 64 slice CT diagnostic centers take a short cut and do not observe this technical requirement.</p>
      <p>Electron Beam Angiogram using e-Speed is an easy and accurate way to check your heart for blockages even when the heart disease is at an early stage.&nbsp;e-Speed can image the heart in colour 3D without catheterization or hospital admission.&nbsp;No premedication is required.&nbsp;The procedure is&nbsp;quick (taking only 20 minutes), painless,&nbsp;and with minimal risk. You can view your heart on the spot.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Heartscan International&nbsp;also offers scanning of other parts of the body in order to detect other major killer diseases namely stroke and cancer.&nbsp;Cancer if detected at an early stage can usually be treated with good long term results.</p>
