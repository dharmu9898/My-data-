	  <p>DSH is owned and managed by the KPJ Healthcare Berhad, the largest healthcare group in Malaysia, which ensures appropriate implementation of clinical governance and quality standards in all its partner concerns.</p>
	  <p>About KPJ</p>
	  <p>KPJ Healthcare Berhad (KPJ Healthcare), the healthcare arm of Johor corporation, was incorporated in 1992 as an investment holding company. It comprises of 33 subsidiary and associate companies with principal activities in providing medical and specialist healthcare services.</p>
	  <p>KPJ Healthcare is primarily a healthcare focussed group, and its portfolio of businesses includes</p>
	  <p>&bull; Hospital management</p>
	  <p>&bull; Healthcare technical services</p>
	  <p>&bull; Hospital development and commissioning</p>
	  <p>&bull; Continuing medical education</p>
	  <p>&bull; Pathology services</p>
	  <p>&bull; Central procurement and retail pharmacy</p>
	  <p>Through KPJ Healthcare&rsquo;s main strategic business unit, the business of hospital management, the Group owns and manages 13 private specialist hospitals throughout Malaysia. In addition, KPJ Healthcare also manages 2 hospitals in Indonesia and 1 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Group has five additional service companies that provide year round services to support the hospitals operations.</p>
	  <p>KPJ Healthcare has a pool of expert professionals and experienced managers, which gives it a firm foundation within the healthcare industry. As KPJ Healthcare approaches its 25th anniversary, it is positioned to become the major player of healthcare services both nationally and internationally.</p>
	  <p>Company Philosophy</p>
	  <p>The company&rsquo;s guiding principles and leadership works towards inspiring excellence, encouraging individual initiative and teamwork by building on KPJ&rsquo;s strengths and capabilities.</p>
	  <p>The Group emphasises on its 5 Core Values namely Safety, Courtesy, Integrity, Professionalism and Continuous Improvement, in order to deliver quality healthcare services to its national and international customers.</p>
	  <p>Company financials and growth trend</p>
	  <p>On 29 November 1994, the Group set history and became the first healthcare group listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia, with RM854 million worth of assets and shareholders funds of RM359 million, along with a paid up capital of RM201 million.</p>

	  <p>Clinical Governance</p>
	  <p>KPJ Healthcare has also established a clinical governance framework to ensure the provision of the highest standards of safety and appropriate patient care in all KPJ Healthcare Hospitals. The framework provides KPJ Healthcare hospitals with specific, stringent guidelines pertaining to the management of clinical risk, ultimately creating a culture of clinical safety.</p>
	  <p>This is done through introducing and formulating operational clinical policies and procedures, proper credentialing and privileging process, the setting up of a broad framework for clinical audit, continuous reviewing and monitoring, quality assurance activities as well as the establishment of evidence based best practices. The Director of each hospital oversees, guides, and leads the implementation of clinical governance policies and procedures at the hospital level.</p>

	  <p>APSH was awarded the 2nd consecutive cycle for a full 3 year Hospital Accreditation status by the Malaysian Society for Quality in Health (MSQH) valid until 2006. ISH and DSH successfully achieved this full 3-year accreditation certification for the period of 2004 - 2007.</p>

	  <p>PNC was recognized as the first private nursing college in Malaysia to be accredited by the National Accreditation Board (LAN) for issuance of its Diploma in Nursing in 2004, allowing the opportunity to recruit foreign students into its nursing programmes, thus taking PNC another step closer to its aspiration to become an international provider of quality nursing training.</p>
