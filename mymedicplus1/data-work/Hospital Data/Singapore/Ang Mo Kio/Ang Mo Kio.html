    <td><p><strong>Senior Patient Services Coordinator, Mardia Hassan</strong></p>
      <p>&quot;I have found my career with Ang Mo Kio &ndash; Thye Hua Kwan Hospital to be rewarding largely due to the variety of opportunities I have enjoyed.</p>
      <p>As part of a forward-moving organization, I have grown and developed professional and interpersonal skills which have made me a more all-rounded team player.&quot;</p>
      <br/>
      
      <p><strong>Senior Staff Nurse, Ng Mui Choo</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;I joined Ang Mo Kio &ndash; Thye Hua Kwan Hospital after I finished my Nursing Diploma in 2002. As a new member of the nursing team then, I was not just warmly welcomed by the team, but learned valuable lessons in nursing care from the senior staff. The pro-learning working environment of the hospital is a big bonus to all new staff who join us.&quot;</p></td>
