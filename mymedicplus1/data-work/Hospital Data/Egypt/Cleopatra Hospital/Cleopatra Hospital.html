    <td><p>We in Cleopatra received our first patient in 1984. The services we offer focus on two major aspects, clinical excellence ethical conduct, in a cost effective single source solution. This is attained by very close collaboration between the Hospital many consultants holding honorary chairs senior lectureships in the university. The new building which was annexed to the hospital early 1999 is a material testimony to a success story. Keeping that momentum looking to further progress we intend after crossing to the new millennium.</p>
