    <td><p>Our privately owned and managed spa and rehabilitation centre for neurology and orthopaedics is situated northeast of Vienna in the Lower Austrian Weinviertel (wine region). Klinik Pirawarth was opened in 1998 and, since then, has become a centre for convalescence and living enjoyment for many people.</p>
      <p>The high standard of accommodation with 4-star facilities, deliberately dissociated from the hospital environment, is an example of the new generation of rehabilitation centres and hotel clinics.</p>
      <p>Built around the lines of the Austrian country house style, the clinic can accommodate 228 patients and guests who are attended to, 24 hours a day, by a staff of 280.</p>
      <p>We offer you and your carer a high quality hotel service. The light and comfortable rooms offer an open view over the surrounding countryside and are properly fitted out for disabled guests. To make your stay as pleasant as possible we also offer an extensive recreational programme.</p>
      <p>A team of medical specialists and general practitioners, along with therapists, nursing personnel and dieticians, is there to work with you and develop an individually tailored treatment and training programme which will include creative and holistic elements.</p>
      <p>Critical factors determining the success of the programme include determination, and collaborative thinking and behaviour.<br />

    <td><h1>Quality Award &ldquo;Best Health Austria&rdquo;</h1>
    <p>With the support of the Ministry of Economics and Employment, the company &lsquo;Best Health Austria for Wellness Tourism&rsquo; was set up in 2003 by leading companies and organisations in the Austrian wellness industry.</p>
    <p>Best Health Austria has the task of assisting companies and regions involved in health, rehabilitation and spa facilities to establish themselves in national and international markets.</p>
    <p>Towards the realisation of this goal, a quality award, to be recognised nationally and EU-wide, was set up. The incentive to obtain and retain this award should ensure the continuous improvement of quality of service.</p>
    <p>In the certification phase we put our working procedures under the microscope and examined the quality of our service. The high level of engagement of Dijana Hofegger, our director of nursing, and the strong support of all personnel, was rewarded with the Best Health Austria Silver Award in 2005.</p>
    <p>This award is evidence of our commitment to provide our patients and guests with high quality, real, tangible and lasting health benefits. We also understand that it is incumbent upon us not only to maintain this level of service, but to continuously improve it. </p></td>
