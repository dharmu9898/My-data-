      <p>I would like to thank Dr. Chavarr&iacute;a and his staff for all expert attention I received in his office and the clinic. Dr. Chavarr&iacute;a showed care for me by coming to the house where I was staying, after surgery when I needed care.<br />
        I would return to Dr. Chavarria in the future if I was considering more surgery.</p>

      <p>I was a major decision to have this surgery done to my body, it Hill change my looks for life, but I choose to have this done here in Costa Rica as the Country is both stable and beautiful. The doctor was wonderful and made me feel very comfortable and sure. I&rsquo;m now happy.<br />
        I came to your clinic and I wish you all the best in the future.</p>
      <p>Thank you!<br />
