	All surgery procedures by <strong>Dr Rodrigo Araya</strong> are performed in a private hospital in San Jos&eacute;, with the most advanced  technology for your well being. Patients are required to check into the  hospital on the morning of the surgery and normally remain in the  hospital for one night following major surgery. Our hospital is  equipped with the most modern medical equipment operated by qualified  personnel, so that you may be assured of the finest service available.  Our affiliation with the Ochsner Medical Institute, located in New  Orleans, USA provides for the latest technical and diagnostic services.<br />
	    <br />
	  Whether  your surgery is done on an outpatient or an inpatient basis, our staff  will pick you up at the hospital and will drive you to one of our  recovery retreats just outside the city of San Jos&eacute;. You will be  monitored carefully during your recovery period by nurses specially  trained in post-cosmetic surgery care. While you may make your own  arrangements for accomodation during your recovery period, it is  recommended that you stay at one of our private recovery retreats where  you will receive the best of care.<br />
	  <br />
	  Each patient assumes a  different degree of risk with every surgical procedure and these risks  will be explained by your surgeon who will make certain that you  understand completely before you begin any procedure. No surgeon can  guarantee a complication-free outcome for any procedure.
