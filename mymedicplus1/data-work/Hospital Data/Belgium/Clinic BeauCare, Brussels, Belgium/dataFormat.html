    <td><p> &bull;I had my cosmetic surgery done in Belgium in October 2008. I had to go alone as my husband had to look after the children while I was away. I arrived the Thursday evening, as my consultation was booked for 10:00 the Friday morning, after which I had my surgery done (I had breast augmentation). I travelled by Eurostar and also stayed in the Hotel Campanile which is very basic and standard, but reasonably priced and the food is very good. My surgery took place at 13:00 that same day as the consultation, and I was allowed to stay in the clinic until closing time at 19:00. I wanted to stay as long as possible, as I had to travel back to the hotel alone and wanted to make sure I was feeling fine to do so. The nurses and all the staff were exceptionally professional and helpful and arranged a taxi for me to take me to the hotel. I was very stressed about the procedure and worried that I was unable to cope alone, but two full days of rest in the hotel proved to be sufficient! I will recommend Clinic BeauCare to anyone, and hope that your experience is as pleasurable as mine was! They do really encourage breast sizes that suit your frame and your build, which is really important in achieving a natural end result! I am ecstatic about my breast enlargement and feel that they have done an amazing job who made me feel at ease and seemed to genuinely care for my well being! Thanks again!<br />

      <p>&bull;I have just returned from Clinic Beaucare, after having liposculpture on my legs. This is my second trip to Belgium for cosmetic surgery, my first being to another clinic. I was totally impressed with the clinic, the surgeon, and just how attentive they were in recovery room. I would give this clinic 10 out of 5 if possible. And am already going back to have another procedure in April. I stayed in the Campanile hotel by the station, which was also lovely, the rooms were beautiful and clean and staff extremely helpful. For anyone who is considering Clinic BeauCare for plastic surgery, i would say you can&rsquo;t go wrong.<br />
        xx</p>
      <p>&bull;I had 6 areas of liposculpture at Clinic Beaucare in Belgium on Monday 15th December, 2008. I travelled from Ebsfleet to Brussels and 3 stops up on a connecting train was the hotel Campanile where I stayed ,1/2 mile from clinic Beaucare where I had my cosmetic surgery!! All I can say is every part of my journey, surgery and stay were all extremely good and I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to go back or recommend to anyone. All the staff at Beaucare were so welcoming, calming and nothing was too much trouble!! Everything went smoothly , my operation was at 9am and I returned to the hotel at 4pm and travelled back the next morning on the Eurostar!! The hotel was so clean, staff helpful and friendly and ideal for what I needed it for! The staff and surgeon at Clinic Beaucare are at the other end of the phone to answer any questions you need to know and nothing is too much trouble.<br />
        xx</p>
      <p>&bull;I would like to say that I am extremely happy with how the surgery (I had breast enlargement) went and the overall outcome. Also I appreciate the aftercare that you have provided me with talking to both myself and my GP. I will definately be recommending your clinic Beaucare to friends who wish to have cosmetic surgery.<br />
        Many thanks<br />
        Kerry</p>
      <p>&bull;I am 12 days post operative having been to the clinic on Weds 5th march for full tummy tuck.<br />
        Have to say up to now my recovery has been great, I had the drains out.<br />
        I have been to my GP surgery today to have stitches removed.<br />
        I am pleased that the strips were used on my skin as hopefully there will be minimum scarring.<br />
        Can I say that I will highly recommend clinic BeauCare for plastic surgery, as so far so good with my operation and healing process .<br />
        Julie</p>
      <p>&bull;First of all, would you please be able to pass on my thanks to the surgeon who did my breast enlargement 2 weeks ago on the 17th June at clinic BeauCare. I am so happy so far with the results. I had my stitches taken out today and I&rsquo;m so happy with the way everything looks. The surgeon has done a wonderful job.. Thank you for your help.<br />
        Kayley</p>
      <p>&bull;I am now nearly six weeks post op and I am so chuffed with my new arms (had arm lift at BeauCare). My war wounds, as I call them, are still pink but I am using Bio Oil and they seem to be getting much better. My healing, apart from a slight soft tissue infection, was fast so thanks to the tip on your Forum which recommended Arnica.<br />
        My confidence has rocketed, my choice of clothes has changed to ones without sleeves and I look fabulous in my wedding dress. I cannot thank you and the staff at Clinic BeauCare enough for giving me my confidence back and for helping me achieve my most longed for wish in time for my dream wedding day.<br />
        A little bit about the surgery, and our stay at Hotel Campanile. Dr Polvier was brilliant, and a very skilled surgeon. The staff at BeauCare were excellent, especially the post op nurses who were kind and attentive. A special mention to Helga, who fielded many of my questions before the surgery, and who I met on the day. I would recommend Clinic BeauCare to anyone for plastic surgery.<br />
        The hotel was great, very clean, reasonably priced ,very helpful, friendly and good food (if slightly pricy).<br />
        Thank you again<br />
        Erika</p>
      <p>&bull;I came to your clinic on September 10th with my mother. She had upper eyelid surgery and I had a breast augmentation. Two weeks on we are both recovering well and so far very pleased with the results!<br />
        I would like to express on behalf of us both how pleased we were with the treatment we received at your clinic. Prior to our journey to Brussels, we had quite a few telephone conversations and emails with yourselves, each time our questions were answered and you were very polite. Upon our arrival, everyone was very friendly, professional and reassuring. I was particularly nervous, having never had an anaesthetic before, but the surgeon and anaesthetist helped to calm my fears. We received good care after the surgery had taken place until we left the clinic - in a taxi ordered by yourselves.<br />
        Since returning to the UK, many friends have asked if I would recommend clinic BeauCare for a cosmetic surgery experience and I have said yes every time!<br />
        Kind regards<br />
        Claire</p>
      <p>&bull;I had cosmetic surgery 1 week ago..(breast augmentation). I would like to write a testimonial about your clinic. I am very pleased with my results, the care at your clinic and your staff. Also because you do not have any black women&rsquo;s photos, I would like you to use mine as it will help to promote other black women to use your clinic. I waited 18 years for this breast operation and I&rsquo;m so glad I made the choice of using clinic BeauCare. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me at any time.<br />
        yours truly grateful<br />
        Denise</p>
      <p>&bull;I did a breast reduction at clinic BeauCare approx. 2 weeks ago and I just wanted to thank you for all. You were all very nice and hospitable. Thanks to the surgeon. Until now I don&rsquo;t have any problems and I recovered very fast. My breast still looks a bit funny, but I feel me in my body much better, than before..<br />
        Kind regards,<br />
        Nadine</p>
      <p>&bull;I had my breast uplift with a little reduction on the 5th September 2008 12pm at Clinic Beaucare. I arrived home on the 09/09/08 about 6.30pm (used the Eurostar) and at work today (10/09/08) feeling a little tired and very<br />
        very little pain (not taking any pain killers as not needed).<br />
        Everything went to plan, everybody was fantastic, right now I am very impressed with the results and the service I received at Clinic BeauCare.<br />
        I would recommend the Clinic to everybody for plastic surgery as the price, service and location is perfect.<br />
        Sandra</p>
      <p>&bull;Regarding my plastic surgery (I had breast augmentation), I don't have any questions to ask, my breasts are healing very fast and I am so very pleased with the result indeed!!!!! I just want to thank all of you at Clinic BeauCare and obviously in particular Doctor Frank Plovier for the amazing job that he has done, which is just what I always dreamt to have in my life.....I 'm so glad I came to your clinic...<br />
        Kindest regards,<br />
        Michela</p>
      <p>&bull;Dear Clinic Beaucare<br />
        I just wanted to write a short email to thank everyone especially Dr Plovier for my new boobs (I had breast augmentation, breast lift and upper eyelid correction).<br />
        I am healing very well and have had absolutely no problems whatsoever - in fact I am already doing light exercises back at the gym. I am also pleased with the surgery on the upper eyelids too and am able to wear make up properly for the first time in years.<br />
        I have recommended Clinic BeauCare to all of my friends and will possibly be looking at coming back for another cosmetic surgery later in the year myself.<br />
        Once again, thanks to the Clinic for a first class service.<br />
        Kind regards<br />
        Lisa</p>
      <p>&bull;Firstly I would just like to thank everyone at Clinic Beaucare for the excellent treatment I received on the 3rd of December 2008 when I had my breast augmentation and nipple lift. My breasts have healed amazingly well, the scar around the nipple is already so well healed that it is not possible to see that I have had surgery unless you look from about 10cm. I will not hesitate to recommend the clinic to anyone I know who wants to have a cosmetic surgery procedure. If you would like post surgical photos in order to show other potential patients I would be very happy to attend Harley Street so that the photos could be taken.<br />
        Once again, very many thanks for the excellent care and treatment I have had.</p>
      <p>&bull;My name is Emma and I live in London.<br />
        I already consulted 2 plastic surgeons in London when I saw an advertisement of Clinic Beaucare in Elle. I was really desperate for a breast augmentation, but I couldn&rsquo;t afford a treatment in the UK. Therefore I went to see the surgeon of Clinic BeauCare. The consultation was very professional and their fee was really affordable. I decided to have the operation at their Brussels clinic and I still do not regret my decision!<br />
        The clinic is intimate, clean and their staff is very warm &amp; friendly. I had a very nice stay at the clinic and the plastic surgeon, Dr. Plovier, did a wonderful job! I had my breast augmentation 6 months ago and I can&rsquo;t wait for summer to start. Finally, after so many years, I am now looking forward to going to the beach, thanks to Clinic BeauCare!</p>
      <p>&bull;My name is Jim and I&rsquo;m from Birmingham.<br />
        During my college years I practised a lot of sports. Once I started working I did not have enough time left to visit the gym anymore. Very soon my body started changing and it became noticeable (I became fat, especially in some areas). After thinking about liposculpture for two years I contacted Clinic BeauCare, which I was told about during one of my trips to Belgium. After the first consultation, which took place in London, I was convinced that this was the right clinic for me. The surgery itself was done at their private clinic in Brussels, where I stayed for only two more days, which was convenient for my job.<br />
        Now, almost a year later I have my old body back, I didn&rsquo;t expect such an amazing result, but I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine how happy this makes me! I wish I hadn&rsquo;t waited this long before I having the surgery.</p>
      <p>&bull;I had a breast augmentation done at Clinic BeauCare in Brussels and I&rsquo;m very pleased with the whole procedure and the final result! At first I was a bit sceptic about going abroad for this surgery but in hindsight I&rsquo;m so happy that I took this decision. The team was very warm &amp; friendly and Dr. Plovier is a wonderful surgeon! I would recommend Clinic BeauCare to everyone, who is looking for a professional treatment in an intimate atmosphere. Kirstin.</p>
      <p>&bull;My name is Catherine, 35 years old, and I live in the north London area.<br />
        After consulting 2 different plastic surgeons in the UK, I started looking for a surgeon abroad. Since I have 3 children under the age of 5 I can not stay away from home for a long period of time ; therefore I chose ClinicBeaucare in Belgium to have my abdominoplasty done. Of course I searched the internet on the credibility of this clinic and surgeons. It appeared that Dr. Plovier is a very well known plastic surgeon and is registered at the GMC, which I deemed very important. Anyway, I still do not regret my choice. I had my surgery done in December and cannot wait for summer to get here so that I can show my &lsquo;new&rsquo; tummy to everybody!<br />
        The clinic is small but very clean and cosy, the staff is very friendly and they all speak English very well. Before going to the OR you have a last consultation with Dr. Plovier, who is such a nice man! I felt really comfortable. After surgery we stayed in a hotel during 4 days. I had my drains removed before we took the Euro Star back to London. The recovery took approximately 4 weeks but I felt better day by day. I&rsquo;m so happy with the surgery and would recommend Clinic BeauCare to every one! Thanks Clinic BeauCare! Regards, Elisabeth.</p>
      <p>&bull;Hi, I&rsquo;m Richard from Macclesfield, I&rsquo;m 47 and I am an airline pilot. I am pretty vain, but despite my good daily care I could no longer hide the traces of aging. I didn&rsquo;t need a lot of time to convince myself to have a facelift . Then I saw an ad in &lsquo;Men&rsquo;s Health&rsquo; for a clinic in Belgium. I immediately contacted Clinic Beaucare and to my surprise they could meet me for a first consultation in their Manchester office, during which they recommended me a mini facelift instead of a full one. Recovery after the surgery is faster and is the procedure itself is cheaper. Going to Belgium for the surgery was no problem for me. After two days I went home and resumed work after three weeks. I received good remarks from my colleagues; they all thought I must have had a great holiday, since I looked ten years younger. I knew why. I want to thank the people of Clinic Beaucare for a job well done.<br />
