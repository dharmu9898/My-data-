    <td><p> I had my cosmetic surgery done in Belgium in October 2008. I had to go alone as my husband had to look after the children while I was away. I arrived the Thursday evening, as my consultation was booked for 10:00 the Friday morning, after which I had my surgery done (I had breast augmentation). I travelled by Eurostar and also stayed in the Hotel Campanile which is very basic and standard, but reasonably priced and the food is very good. My surgery took place at 13:00 that same day as the consultation, and I was allowed to stay in the clinic until closing time at 19:00. I wanted to stay as long as possible, as I had to travel back to the hotel alone and wanted to make sure I was feeling fine to do so. The nurses and all the staff were exceptionally professional and helpful and arranged a taxi for me to take me to the hotel. I was very stressed about the procedure and worried that I was unable to cope alone, but two full days of rest in the hotel proved to be sufficient! I will recommend Clinic BeauCare to anyone, and hope that your experience is as pleasurable as mine was! They do really encourage breast sizes that suit your frame and your build, which is really important in achieving a natural end result! I am ecstatic about my breast enlargement and feel that they have done an amazing job who made me feel at ease and seemed to genuinely care for my well being! Thanks again!<br/>

      <p>I have just returned from Clinic Beaucare, after having liposculpture on my legs. This is my second trip to Belgium for cosmetic surgery, my first being to another clinic. I was totally impressed with the clinic, the surgeon, and just how attentive they were in recovery room. I would give this clinic 10 out of 5 if possible. And am already going back to have another procedure in April. I stayed in the Campanile hotel by the station, which was also lovely, the rooms were beautiful and clean and staff extremely helpful. For anyone who is considering Clinic BeauCare for plastic surgery, i would say you can&rsquo;t go wrong.<br />
        <strong>xx</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>I had 6 areas of liposculpture at Clinic Beaucare in Belgium on Monday 15th December, 2008. I travelled from Ebsfleet to Brussels and 3 stops up on a connecting train was the hotel Campanile where I stayed ,1/2 mile from clinic Beaucare where I had my cosmetic surgery!! All I can say is every part of my journey, surgery and stay were all extremely good and I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to go back or recommend to anyone. All the staff at Beaucare were so welcoming, calming and nothing was too much trouble!! Everything went smoothly , my operation was at 9am and I returned to the hotel at 4pm and travelled back the next morning on the Eurostar!! The hotel was so clean, staff helpful and friendly and ideal for what I needed it for! The staff and surgeon at Clinic Beaucare are at the other end of the phone to answer any questions you need to know and nothing is too much trouble.<br />

      <p>   <br/>I would like to say that I am extremely happy with how the surgery (I had breast enlargement) went and the overall outcome. Also I appreciate the aftercare that you have provided me with talking to both myself and my GP. I will definately be recommending your clinic Beaucare to friends who wish to have cosmetic surgery.<br />
        Many thanks<br />
        <strong>Kerry</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>I am 12 days post operative having been to the clinic on Weds 5th march for full tummy tuck.<br />
        Have to say up to now my recovery has been great, I had the drains out.<br />
        I have been to my GP surgery today to have stitches removed.<br />
        I am pleased that the strips were used on my skin as hopefully there will be minimum scarring.<br />
        Can I say that I will highly recommend clinic BeauCare for plastic surgery, as so far so good with my operation and healing process .<br />
        <strong>Julie</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>First of all, would you please be able to pass on my thanks to the surgeon who did my breast enlargement 2 weeks ago on the 17th June at clinic BeauCare. I am so happy so far with the results. I had my stitches taken out today and I&rsquo;m so happy with the way everything looks. The surgeon has done a wonderful job.. Thank you for your help.<br />
        <strong>Kayley</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>I am now nearly six weeks post op and I am so chuffed with my new arms (had arm lift at BeauCare). My war wounds, as I call them, are still pink but I am using Bio Oil and they seem to be getting much better. My healing, apart from a slight soft tissue infection, was fast so thanks to the tip on your Forum which recommended Arnica.<br />
        My confidence has rocketed, my choice of clothes has changed to ones without sleeves and I look fabulous in my wedding dress. I cannot thank you and the staff at Clinic BeauCare enough for giving me my confidence back and for helping me achieve my most longed for wish in time for my dream wedding day.<br />
        A little bit about the surgery, and our stay at Hotel Campanile. Dr Polvier was brilliant, and a very skilled surgeon. The staff at BeauCare were excellent, especially the post op nurses who were kind and attentive. A special mention to Helga, who fielded many of my questions before the surgery, and who I met on the day. I would recommend Clinic BeauCare to anyone for plastic surgery.<br />
        The hotel was great, very clean, reasonably priced ,very helpful, friendly and good food (if slightly pricy).<br />
        Thank you again<br />
        <strong>Erika</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>I came to your clinic on September 10th with my mother. She had upper eyelid surgery and I had a breast augmentation. Two weeks on we are both recovering well and so far very pleased with the results!<br />
        I would like to express on behalf of us both how pleased we were with the treatment we received at your clinic. Prior to our journey to Brussels, we had quite a few telephone conversations and emails with yourselves, each time our questions were answered and you were very polite. Upon our arrival, everyone was very friendly, professional and reassuring. I was particularly nervous, having never had an anaesthetic before, but the surgeon and anaesthetist helped to calm my fears. We received good care after the surgery had taken place until we left the clinic - in a taxi ordered by yourselves.<br />
        Since returning to the UK, many friends have asked if I would recommend clinic BeauCare for a cosmetic surgery experience and I have said yes every time!<br />
        Kind regards<br />
        <strong>Claire</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>I had cosmetic surgery 1 week ago..(breast augmentation). I would like to write a testimonial about your clinic. I am very pleased with my results, the care at your clinic and your staff. Also because you do not have any black women&rsquo;s photos, I would like you to use mine as it will help to promote other black women to use your clinic. I waited 18 years for this breast operation and I&rsquo;m so glad I made the choice of using clinic BeauCare. Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact me at any time.<br />
        yours truly grateful<br />
        <strong>Denise</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>I did a breast reduction at clinic BeauCare approx. 2 weeks ago and I just wanted to thank you for all. You were all very nice and hospitable. Thanks to the surgeon. Until now I don&rsquo;t have any problems and I recovered very fast. My breast still looks a bit funny, but I feel me in my body much better, than before..<br />
        Kind regards,<br />
        <strong>Nadine</strong></p>
      <p>   <br/>I had my breast uplift with a little reduction on the 5th September 2008 12pm at Clinic Beaucare. I arrived home on the 09/09/08 about 6.30pm (used the Eurostar) and at work today (10/09/08) feeling a little tired and very<br />
        very little pain (not taking any pain killers as not needed).<br />
        Everything went to plan, everybody was fantastic, right now I am very impressed with the results and the service I received at Clinic BeauCare.<br />
        I would recommend the Clinic to everybody for plastic surgery as the price, service and location is perfect.<br />
