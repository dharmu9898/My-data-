  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><strong>Endovascular and Interventional Radiology</strong><br />
      Endovascular and interventional radiology is treatment of veins and arteries by either inserting a catheter or other medical devices into the desired spot in those blood vessels or organs using DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography).</p>    
      <p><strong>Uterine Fibroid Embolization</strong><br />
      Uterine Fibroid Embolization (UFE) is an FDA approved minimal-invasive procedure used to remove fibroid tumors in the uterus. The procedure does not  require general anesthesia and recovery time is faster compared to open surgery.</p>
      <p><strong>Digital Mammogram</strong><br />
      Digital mammography is the latest innovation in the fight against breast cancer and allows more accurate diagnosis and earlier discovery than previous methods, particularly in women under 50.</p>
      <p><strong>Greenlight PVP Laser for Prostate Treatment</strong><br />
      One of the most common and painful afflictions experienced by men over 50 is prostate enlargement. At BMC, we offer PVP laser treatment (photo-selective vaporization of the prostate) to precisely target prostate tissue with a high-powered laser beam. This innovative treatment is significantly less invasive than previous methods and is often performed in an out-patient setting.</p>
      <p><strong>PET/CT Scanner</strong><br />
        Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Scanner<br />
      The first combination PET/CT scanner in Thailand is a major advancement in imaging technology and patient care and is the most functional imaging technology available today. Applications range from the early detection of cancers and assessment of heart muscle viability, to the evaluation of functional brain anatomy in dementia, epilepsy and stroke.</p>
      <p><strong>Novalis Shaped Beam Surgery System Installed and Operating</strong><br />
      Novalis is a dedicated system for non-invasive stereotactic radiosurgery (a high dose of radiation applied in a single session) and stereotactic radiotherapy (radiation administered in a series of treatment sessions). What makes Novalis special is the precision with which it applies doses of radiation, allowing it to destroy diseased tissue or cauterize a problem area without affecting healthy adjacent tissue. Novalis has numerous treatment applications, including cancerous tumors, arteriovenous malformations and Parkinson's disease.</p>
      <p><strong>4D Ultrasound</strong><br />
      With the speed of 25 volumes per second, the latest 4D ultrasound creates a motion life-like picture.</p>
      <p><strong>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI - Intra Achiva 3.0T MRI)</strong><br />
      Advances in MRI technology are paving the way for a wide range of treatments and procedures by providing extremely accurate, high-contrast images of internal organs. Unlike conventional x-rays, MRI scans yield the detailed information necessary to discover blood circulation abnormalities and are particularly useful in the early detection of brain cancer. BMC is proud to possess the latest and most advanced MRI to date, the 3.0 Tesla.</p>
      <p><strong>Gamma Knife Surgery</strong><br />
      Gamma Knife surgery marks a turning point in the treatment of neurological diseases. Invented by a Swedish doctor, the system makes non-invasive brain surgery possible by applying highly targeted gamma radiation to the treatment of tumors, arteriovenous malformations of the brain and functional disorders. BMC is the first and only hospital in Thailand to offer Gamma Knife treatment for neurological diseases.</p>
      <p><strong>IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy)</strong><br />
      IMRT is an innovative cancer treatment that utilizes ionizing radiation in the treatment of malignant tumors. Using high-powered computers, IMRT is able to focus radiation doses on tumors without damaging the surrounding tissue. This advance in tumor targeting results in fewer side effects and better overall treatment.</p>
      <p><strong>Minimal Invasive Heart Surgery</strong><br />
        A breakthrough technology for cardiac surgery, the da Vinci Surgical System uses robotics to translate the surgeon's natural hand movements into the micromovements of a robotic arm. With the aid of viewing monitor, the surgeon is able to apply less invasive incisions with unprecedented precision, lowering risk, accelerating recovery, and greatly reducing scarring.<br />

      A total knee replacement</strong><br />
      Regina Siemoneit who is from New Jersey in the USA was told that the time had come to have booth knees replaced. She was apprehensive about going to an American Hospital. She had visited Thailand several times in the past and was impressed by the kindness of the Thai people. She contacted the Bangkok Hospital and had a lengthy correspondence with one of our Orthopedic Surgeons. Following this she came to Bangkok Hospital and had a bilateral knee replacement operation</p>

        Prostate Cancer</strong><br />
      While vacationing in Thailand, Ron Tedder paid a visit to Bangkok Hospital Medical Center after spraining his ankle during a trip to a local temple. Receiving prompt treatment for his ankle, he decided to sign up for a same-day Men's Health Check-Up to ensure that he was in otherwise good health.</p>
      <p><strong>Karen Tedder, England<br />

        Breast Cancer</strong><br />
      Within a year of receiving treatment for his prostate cancer at Bangkok Hospital Medical Center, Ron Tedder's wife Karen was diagnosed with breast cancer. &quot;What was the prognosis?&quot; explains Karen, &quot;a shrug with a shoulder. I just didn't feel things were being managed properly in Canterbury, and after Ron's experience with cancer and the outstanding treatment he received at Bangkok Hospital, I felt the decision was an easy one.&quot;</p>

        Emergency Femur Operation </strong><br />
      As the date of my departure for home to Hawaii nears, I feel that I must once again thank all of my &lsquo;family' at the Bangkok Hospital for the excellent care that I received and experienced during my stay there. I use the term &lsquo;family' because I truly felt that each and every person that I came into contact with made me feel as though I was a member of their family - close or distant. </p>

      Ik ben December 2007 geopereerd aan mijn blinde darm in Bangkok. Niet geheel in de planning tijdens mijn rondtrip van 4 maanden door Azie, maar achteraf een van de beste locaties om het te moeten ondergaan.

        Heart</strong><br />
        Hierbij doe ik U mijn ervaring toekomen van mijn opname in het Bangkok Hart Hospital  dd 20 April 2007<br />
        Ik werd getroffen door een hartinfarct terwijl wij net waren begonnen aan onze 30 daagse vakantie in thailand,door toedoen van onze reisleider. Wij waren + minus 100 km buiten Bangkok en het Bangkok Hart hospital heeft  onmiddellijk maatregelen genomen om mij zsm naar het ziekenhuis te transporteren. Ik werd vervoerd in een hypermoderne Hart ambulance die heel volledig was uitgerust  tot en met de Ambulance cardioloog aan toe, die gedurende de rit al het mogelijke deed om de rit zo pijnloos en comfortabel als mogelijk was voor mij te doen zijn.<br />
