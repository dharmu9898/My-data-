    <td><p>To Miss Cheng (Susan) , Anesthetists and Nurse at Samitivej Sukhumvit Hospital.</p>
      <p>I came from Taiwan, come here for visit. My name is Zheng ShuLing; All My family and I like Thailand; we have traveled Thailand several times. This time we plan to spend Chinese New year, our hotel located around Shukumvit area.</p>
      <p>26th Jan. 2009 the noontime. When my family and I cross the road, Unlucky I was hit by a car. The Ambulance From Samitivej Sukhumvit Hospital sends me to the Hospital. Because My angel of left foot is broke. It's very hurt, I feel very afraid, and helpless. Because I can't speak Thai language, also I didn't bring my Mobil with me. I feel nervous. At that time ER. Contact with Miss Cheng (Susan) who works in Samitivej Hospital to translate for us, and help us to contact with Taiwan to determine my insurance and other things related to my operation.</p>
      <p>About 18:30 26th JAN. I am ready to take the operation. The Anesthetists and Nurse are very friendly and attentive. The doctor is very professional. The Care workers give me a completed Care. The first day after the operation, I didn't feel any pain and I didn&rsquo;t have any Fever. I can get out of bed and walk around. Everything goes fine, Physiatrists help me to use crutches.</p>
      <p>Now I SOS Doctor will help me to go back to Taiwan. I really thank Samitivej Sukhumvit Hospital and Miss Cheng (Susan) and all the Medical staffs. Samitivej Sukhumvit Hospital is a Five-star hospital and offer Five-star level service, also it is a international hospital. Thanks Susan, Thanks everybody's help.</p>

      To Dr. Boonsaeng Wutthipan, head of Women&rsquo;s Health Center, Samitivej Sukhumvit</p>
      <p> Kantika Kernick, 28, who is married to an Australian, suffered ectopic pregnancy twice and had to have the oviducts removed. Hormone injection also caused too many stigmas to grow. When she learned of the new technology, she decided to try. &ldquo;I am very happy. Earlier I was hopeless because I have a lot of problems with hormone. Having hormone injection everyday is painful. But using IVM, it hurt a bit when the doctor took out the ovum. Now, I am nine week pregnant. My twins will be born on June 28, 2009<br />
        Thank you,<br />

      <p><br />To Dr. Boonsaeng Wutthipan, Women's Health Center Samitivej SUkhumvit Hospital</p>
      <p> Ms. Pattanee Uthaisiriroj, 36, said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled. My husband and I have been married for six years. We actually planned to have baby four years ago but we have never been successful. After consulting with Dr. Boonsaeng, I learned that I have PCOD. I was given some pills to boost ovum fertility. However, I didn&rsquo;t take the pills constantly so it was not successful in the first place. I don&rsquo;t want to have hormone injection. Dr. Boonsaeng therefore recommended this new technology and I decided to try. I did it on September 23 and I am now 10-week pregnant. I am expecting on June 18, 2009.&rdquo;<br />
        Thank you,<br />
