    <td><p align="left">&nbsp;<strong>Testimonials from satisfied clients who had their dental treatment   with a dentist in Alanya, Turkey arranged by Dental Trips Turkey</strong></p>
      <p align="left">Wanted   to write to you straight away to thank you for encouraging me to go forward with   my dental treatment. I am ecstatic with the result and will be sharing the tip   with people here, or anywhere for that matter, who are in need of good   affordable dental work. The entire experience was pleasant&quot;.Dolores, Netherlands </p>
      <p>&ldquo; Very happy exceeded my expectations of what would   be achieved with my teeth&rdquo; Iris Ireland </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Pleased with dental treatment everyone was very   helpful&rdquo;. Ann UK. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Absolutely delighted. Highly recommend Aksel and   the dental practice&rdquo; Lisa Ireland. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I am very happy with treatment I received and very   pleased with the results&rdquo; Irene UK. </p>
      <p>This month Miss R. Allaria returned to Alanya to   complete her dental treatment. After receiving quality treatment, she has   healthy gums and a nice smile. Previously, she was advised by a dentist in Italy   to have all her teeth extracted and have dentures instead. After contacting   Dental Trips Turkey, she decided to travel to Alanya for her dental treatment.   The gum infection was treated successfully without the need to extract all her   teeth. Roberta does not need to wear a full set of dentures. She went on to say   &ldquo;I am very pleased with the dental treatment and service I received. Also, for   this good quality service, the treatment cost was three times cheaper than the   cost I was originally quoted in Italy!&rdquo;. </p>
      <p>&quot;really good clean service. Friendly staff and an   enjoyable experience ,Andrew, UK </p>
      <p>&quot;I will be recommending Dental Trips Turkey&quot; Ted   Ireland </p>
      <p>I phoned Dental Trips Turkey on the Wednesday, flew   out the following Tuesday and spent a week in a 5-Star full board hotel. During   the week, I received over 26 hours of dental care which would have taken in   excess of 9 months appointments with my UK dentist who quoted me &pound;15000 though   would have been more if there were any extra problems&quot;. </p>
      <p>Well, with Dental Trips Turkey, the dental care   service starts at your hotel reception where your driver picks you up and takes   you directly to the clinic. This is a large 3-storey building where you can sit   on the veranda and watch Turkish life go by below when you are having a break   from treatment. You are introduced to your dentist and his assistants, he checks   your teeth then you receive an x-ray and within the hour you're back with the   dentist and x-rays discussing treatment options to fit your budget and once   you've agreed, everything is explained in detail and the work begins. I've never   experienced such competence - I felt totally at ease for the whole week and when   he applied the final fittings, I felt 10 years younger&quot;. </p>
      <p>&quot;My advice to anyone thinking of using this clinic   is DO IT NOW - the sooner you do, the least amount of money it will cost you to   put your teeth right&quot;.Mike UK. November 2008</p>
