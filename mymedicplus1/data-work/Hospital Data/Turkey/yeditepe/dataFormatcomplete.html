    <td><p>Yeditepe University Eye Hospital started admission of patients in Be&#351;ikta&#351; Balmumcu. The hospital was founded as a result of the self-sacrifices and altruism of Mr. Bedrettin Dalan, founder of Istek Foundation.</p>
      <p>The hospital has the following characteristics:</p>
      <p>It is equipped with the most modern and advanced examination and treatment instruments of the world. As the devices were being selected, no sacrifice was avoided, and the most expensive and superior of each brand were preferred. All purchased devices are being upgraded every 3 months (that is, they are replaced if their more advanced models exist).  That is, the instruments are updated with the best.</p>
      <p>* It is established on an area of 3000 square meters.</p>
      <p>* The purpose of the hospital is</p>
      <p> * Service<br />
        * Education<br />
        * Research</p>
      <p>As the hospital provides more luxury and superior service compared to any private hospital with cutting-edge technology, it will serve its patients with the reliability, seriousness, scientific approach of a University hospital with the most recent innovations and researches in the world.</p>
      <p>Most of its doctor staff consists of young, dynamic, and active personnel. Most of its doctors were educated in the USA, Germany and in the best hospitals abroad.</p>
      <p>And its nurse and assisting personnel consist of a very experienced young and dynamic staff educated merely on eye diseases.</p>
      <p>The hospital building is constructed as an intelligent building, and its heating, cooling, ventilation, fire extinguishing, communication and imaging systems are completely computerized.</p>
      <p>4 surgery rooms are ventilated with &ldquo;laminar flow&rdquo; system. Since such system is very expensive, several hospitals in Turkey ventilate their surgery rooms merely with hepa filter. As to the USA, surgery rooms without a laminar flow system are not even permitted to operate. Consequently, our surgery rooms are at US standards, and we can say that they provide the cleanest environment possible in the world.</p>
      <p>We can say that there is no eye hospital even in the USA like ours, which contain all examination and treatment instruments.</p>
      <p>We also have several examination and treatment devices which cannot be found in any other hospital in Turkey, and brought to our country for the first time.</p>
      <p>Examination and treatment of all eye diseases can be made in our hospital. Our patient's does not need to go abroad about anything.</p>
      <p>As a result;</p>
      <p>The founding objective of Yeditepe University Eye Hospital is to provide the most recent examination and treatment possibilities to not only our citizens, but also patients from abroad. Its objective is to make its name known abroad, and become a reference hospital abroad.</p>
      <p>Our target is to become a reference hospital which is a model to the world, an example and a reference to everybody&rsquo;s patients about Eye Diseases.</p>
