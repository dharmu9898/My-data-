	  <h2>About Transmed: Hair restoration and cosmetic surgery</h2>
	  <p>Transmed was founded by Dr.Melike Kulahci-Paeffgen and Reiner Paeffgen in Istanbul February, 1994  as an international medical center in order to offer state of the art hair transplantation surgery in Turkey.</p>
	  <p>In January, 1995, Transmed became the first clinic in Turkey to perform the &ldquo;Mini-micro Grafting&rdquo; technique in hair transplantation surgery.</p>
	  <p>Transmed has started to offer other services along with hair restoration after moving in to its 6400 sq-ft new building in Levent in February 1997.</p>
	  <p>Using the most up to date procedures and technology available, Transmed in October 1997, launched the first web site about hair restoration surgery in Turkey. .</p>
	  <p>As a pioneer in the field of hair transplantation surgery, Transmed introduced the &ldquo;Mega-Mix Grafting&rdquo; technique in February 1998. This technique was developed by the Transmed Medical Team.</p>
	  <p>In May 1998 Transmed launched its unique &ldquo;Mega-Mix-Grafting&rdquo; technique debut at the 1st annual ESHRS meeting held in Rome, Italy.<br />
      </p>
	  <p>In June 1998, Dr. Melike Kulahci-Paeffgen as the owner and medical director of Transmed has been elected to the ESHRS (European Society of Hair Restoration Surgery) as a board member and she gave lectures at the 5th annual ISHRS meeting held in Washington DC, USA</p>
	  <p>In March 1999, as Transmed's medical team continued to pursue its research, was once again the first clinic in Turkey to perform &ldquo;follicular unit transplantation&rdquo; (dissecting the follicles under the microscope) in hair restoration surgery.</p>
	  <p>More achievements have followed and in 1999: Transmed's medical team performed a live surgery at the 2nd annual ESHRS meeting held in Paris, France.</p>
	  <p>In June 2000, Transmed hosted the 3rd annual ESHRS meeting in Istanbul, Turkey with the participation of more then 150 Hair Restoration Surgeons from all over the world.</p>
	  <p>Due to her contributions to the ISHRS, The International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery has elected Dr. Melike Kulahci-Paeffgen in October 2001 as a Governor of the Board of the ISHRS.</p>
	  <p>In order to provide the best service to its customers, Transmed renovated its building during the summer period of 2003. It is now a very modern and relaxing environment with many additional amenities.</p>
	  <p>Transmed started to investigate and establish a noninvasive and scar-free extraction technique in October 2003. This technique is also known as the &ldquo;Woods Technique&quot; or &quot;FUE Technique&quot;.</p>
	  <p>In August 2004, as a result of our doctor's systematic and diligent research, Transmed has been awarded with 2 prestigious prizes by ISHRS (International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons).</p>
