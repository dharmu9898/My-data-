    <td><p>&quot;The <strong>Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad</strong> came into being in 1990, as the first medical institution in Spain wholly specialized in human reproduction.</p>
      <p>This clinic is at the forefront of Reproductive Medicine and its philosophy is based on maximum personal attention, providing concrete solutions for unique human beings. Our method starts with research into the couple and involves analysis, diagnosis, development of the treatment and its application, up to evaluation of the results, all combined with continuous monitoring that throws light on other therapeutic options, in case it is necessary to change the treatment or repeat it in another cycle. All this coupled with the most modern technology to carry out each technique with the maximum guarantee of success.</p>
      <p>We work to satisfy the dreams of couples for responsible, desired paternity, with minimum risk and maximum comfort. However, it is also important that we offer Medicine with a more human face: to provide sensitive psychological counselling, taking into account the emotions and stresses that infertile couples have to contend with.</p>
      <p>With the desire to contribute to the welfare of society, the IVI Team has opened centres in several Spanish cities: IVI Almer&iacute;a, IVI Barcelona, IVI Castell&oacute;n, IVI Madrid, IVI Murcia, and IVI Sevilla, IVI Valencia and IVI Vigo; and outside Spain, IVI M&eacute;xico, IVI Lisboa and IVI Santiago de Chile.</p>
      <p>We are delighted to welcome you to IVI.es, a meeting point for patients and health care professionals in Spain and the rest of the world. Through this website you can find out who we are and how we can help you, placing all of science and technology at the service of fertility.</p>
      <p>If you are a woman, so that you too can have a child; if you are a doctor, for you to know we would like to collaborate with you.&quot;</p>
