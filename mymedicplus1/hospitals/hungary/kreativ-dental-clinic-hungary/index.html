                 <h3>KREATIV DENTAL CLINIC HUNGARY</h3>
		<p><strong>Professional Dentist in Hungary</strong><br />
      Welcome to the Kreativ Dental Clinic. Kreativ lead the way in advanced, high quality, affordable dentistry in Europe.</p>
    <p>If you require cosmetic dentistry or dental implant treatment, you may wish to consider visting our World Class dental facility in Hungary. </p>
    <p>Our patients reguarly save 50% to 70% compared to the quotes they receive in the UK. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you are in need of Dental Implants, Crowns, Bridge Work, Veneers or Teeth Whitening at a price you can afford contact Kreativ Dental on 0845 0945 331.</p>
    <p>Speak to our UK team who will be only too pleased to arrange your trip to see us.</p>
    <p>As a Member of the EU, dental care in Hungary conforms to EU regulations. The Dentists who work at Kreativ have the highest qualifications obtained from Hungary's prestigious Dental Universities and have all worked abroad to gain international experience.</p>
    <p>Our new, purpose built, state-of-the-art Surgery has now opened! Consisting of a fully equipped, high-tech Dental Surgery and Laboratory combined with a Training Centre and specially designed facilities for client's relaxation, it is the most modern and well equipped Dental Clinic in Europe.<br />
    </p>
    <p>As well as the considerable financial savings our patients can enjoy the opportunity of exploring the vibrant city of Budapest perhaps with a companion or family member. </p>
    <p>Travelling abroad to for dental implants or cosmetic dentistry is simple. The professionalism and cost effectiveness of dental surgery there means that Budapest has virtually become the dental capital of Europe. You will save money, and in many cases, time.</p>
    <p>Hungary was the first country to establish a dental university and has since built an enviable reputation as the European capital of dentistry. It is the top European destination for dental tourism. In 2007, more than 25,000 of us Brits travelled to Budapest for Dental Treatment. As one of the first companies to specialize in dental tourism, last year Kreativ opened a new, purpose-built surgery complex. </p>
    <p>England is the most expensive country in Europe for dental treatment. Many patients either cannot afford private care or cannot find an NHS dentist.</p>
    <p>&quot;According to research, the average price for a dental implant in the UK is between &pound;2000 and &pound;2500, but at Kreativ it's &pound;605.00 (GBP).&quot;</p>
    <p>Healthy teeth and good dental hygiene are an essential part of maintaining a good quality of life. Knowing you have a beautiful, healthy and natural looking smile also helps to give you confidence. Neglected, decayed and unhealthy teeth will affect your overall health and missing teeth that are not replaced will probably cause further damage to your jaw line.</p>

    <p>Mr Oliver Howell<br />
      2008 - Apr 15th<br />
      Dear Ben Erskine and Frederick Forsyth I have just returned from my last treatment at Kreativ in Budapest. I would like to say how much I appreciated the care, attention and skill of everyone at Kreativ. The joy of eating properly again is a delight... Noemi in reception was always a cheerful presence giving confidence and very helpful information. I have a particular thanks to for his Peter Magos patience skill and warmth. The way Dr Patonay inserted the implants together with a nasal lift and so little subsequent pain was very impressive. I would be grateful if you would pass my thanks to them all. </p>
    <p>Toni Herbert<br />
      2007 - Dec 3rd<br />
      I had 3 implants and 18 crowns. starting October 2005. The care and treatment was excellent and I couldn`t fault the clinic. All was so good and I shall be shortly going back for my next check. I now have a fantastic smile and would recommend that others have a go. </p>

      Hi, Just got back from my fifth visit to Budapest. I would like to say a heart felt thanks to you and all the staff at the new clinic, they were very professional. While I was there awaiting treatment I read the framed press cuttings on the wall - to my astonishment there was mine in the &lsquo;Liverpool Echo&rsquo;. Regards Gary </p>

      2007 - Oct 3rd <br />
      A very efficient service by caring professionals. The new surgery and its comprehensive equipment would be the envy of Dentists in the UK. I would be very happy to recommend others who require fairly major remedial work. </p>

      I&rsquo;m sorry I did not get a chance to speak to you in person last week. Having finished my treatment now, I just wanted to thank you (and everyone who worked on my teeth) for the service you have provided. I&rsquo;m delighted with the end result. I have recommended the Kreativ Clinic to many people here in the UK and will continue to do so. I wish you every success in the new clinic and in the future. </p>

      I wanted to drop a line to thank you for all your helping with my arrangements to Kreativ Dental in Budapest. I would highly recommend this facility to anyone who asks and already have had two enquiries from locals (Co Clare) as to whether or not they should travel. I had no hesitation in saying yes. I am delighted with the final result. It makes such a difference. Once again, thank you. </p>

      I just wanted to say that I am very pleased with treatment I received. I have had many admiring comments about my teeth, and my husband is considering coming for treatment in the future. Thank you!! My problem would have been ignored in the UK by the National Health, simply because of the cost. </p>

      My wife and I were apprehensive about going abroad to get dental work done. We needn&rsquo;t have worried we were both highly delighted with the outcome and the price we paid. We will certainly be recommending your surgery. </p>

      Thanks to everyone at Kreativ for helping me achieve my ambition of living my life without dentures. Dental implants have made a huge difference to my confidence and I certainly couldn&rsquo;t have afforded to have them in London. I would not to recommend your services to others. </p>

      Just to let you know everything went off brilliantly in Budapest. We felt really well looked after. The dentists obviously knew what they were doing. I had a bridge in the end, so I don&rsquo;t need to go back. Thanks for the ticket for the public transport system which was excellent Many thanks for all your help. </p>

    <p>G S Donegal<br />
      2005 - Dec 9<br />
      Having spent a total of 24 days at Kreativ over 2 visits I think I\&rsquo;m qualified to say it was well worth it. Brilliant! That was my reaction on leaving the \&rsquo;chair\&rsquo; one evening after having 4 extractions (2 of them surgical). I went back to the hotel with my pain-killers (which I never touched!) and went shopping the next day. As is obvious from my length of stay I\&rsquo;ve always hated the dentistry here in Ireland because I thought it always had to be painful traumatic experience but after been to Budapest, I would have no hesitation (and have been) recommending it to everybody who looks likes they need some work done. It\&rsquo;s now a year later and I can smile for the first time in years and I\&rsquo;d make a pretty good tour guide in Budapest. </p>
    <p>A B Mayo<br />
      2005 - Nov 29<br />
      I was nervous and very apprehensive about going abroad to get dental work done. When i got there i was impressed with the friendly and professional manner of the staff and dental team. I am very happy with the service and results and would recommend them to anyone. Money well spent, wish i had done it years ago, love my smile and the break and the beautiful city was an added bonus. </p>
    <p>C L Dublin<br />
      2005 - Nov 13<br />
      My husband and I returned from our treatment/holiday in Budapest in early September, and are both delighted with the outcome and the professionalism with which we were dealt with by all at Kreativ. We also enjoyed visiting the city in Summer, even if being condemned to eating soft food for two weeks does put a damper on things... Thanking you, L A New York<br />
      2005 - Nov 10<br />
      Fabulous! Ivan was my dentist and he is a kind, gentle and patient man who is genius when it comes to teeth (he told me if he was a genius in general he would be better at chess). Attila said my work was easy, and I guess he was right considering what other people needed to have done. I could not be happier with the result. My family, as you predicted, were very impressed. I would not hesitate to do it again or to recommend it to others. Thanks again for your help, it was truly appreciated. </p>
    <p>W C Wicklow<br />
      2005 Nov 09<br />
      Just back from a very successful trip to Budapest.. We were very happy about every aspect of the trip and delighted with the work done at the clinic. I had 8 crowns and Pat had 7 fillings, his teeth extensively cleaned and a new bridge with 4 teeth. All for a fraction of what it would have cost here as you know. I will go back in the future for work on my lower teeth which require crowns ect. The clinic is excellent! Thanks again. </p>
    <p>EC Offaly<br />
      2005 - Oct 22<br />
      Just wanted to thank you for all your help over the last few months - It was very much appreciated. Dental clinic exceeded my expectations. They staff were incredibly efficient and helpful. Was very impressed with the actual dental work too and managed to tour around Budapest including a weekend in Vienna before returning to Ireland. Just wanted to give you some feedback. Many thanks again Maeve </p>
