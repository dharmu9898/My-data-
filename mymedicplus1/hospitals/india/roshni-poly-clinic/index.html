There after mother had another LSCS at my clinic and had male child.<br />
  In last May 2008, mother had appointment at my clinic for her menstrual problem but they came very late after 5 hours of appointment, while asking the reason, they told Sanjida had appointment with neurophysician, as since last 2 years, she is behaving very irregularly- always weeping, crying, not going to nursery, restless, does not eat home food, irritable, violent, hits her head with wall, does not answer properly, daily bed wetting. We are all tired and much worried. Since last 1 &frac12; years, she is under treatment of pediatrician, psychiatrist and now under neurophysician. She was treated by antipsychotic/ anti-anxiety drugs,( all investigation and her EEG is normal), but without any difference. During last 2 years all family including this child visited me frequently but they did not complained about this child. The father and mother told, sir, you are ob/gyn specialists so we thought that this is not your subject so when we were coming to you, we use to keep Sanjida out of your consulting office, otherwise she will disturb you.I stared her homeopathic, ayurvedic and naturopathic drugs and child had surprising improvement within 15 days only.<br />
