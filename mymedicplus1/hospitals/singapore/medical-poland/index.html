<p>The Clinical Hospital No. 10 and Polyclinic came into being in 1985. The primary reason for its establishment was the need to provide medical services to servicemen and their families. In 1999 the Hospital became the Independent State Healthcare Institution, which enabled it to provide medical services to all citizens. Today the Hospital is one of the largest and most modern hospitals in Poland, which takes advantage of the experience of medical service, creating conditions which meet the essential European Union requirements and NATO standards. The Hospital offers comprehensive diagnostics and treatment of patients at the highest, third reference level. <br><br>

The functional layout of hospital units and a wide range of treatments offered make the hospital meet the requirements set for an institution offering treatment of multiorgan injuries. The Hospital possesses a helicopter pad, Emergency Department connected with the Operating Theatre and Intensive Medical Care Unit. It has a new, 10-room operating theatre, which comprises the central sterilization room, Intensive Care Unit and one of the most modern operating theatres in the world, equipped with a neuronavigation system, used in 2 operating rooms, and an intraoperative system of CT imaging.<br><br>

Thanks to extensive computer network we are able to transfer diagnostic information to particular units. The network has also been adapted to teleconsultation and image transfer from operating rooms to classes for the purpose of doctor and student education. We can actively participate in panel discussions, conferences, working meetings with centres all over the world and all this thanks to telemedic connections. This system is also used for medical consultation and surgical procedures performed by doctors from our Hospital and Peace Mission Hospital during peace missions.</p><br>

				<h6>Main operating theatre</h6>
<p>The Main Operating Theatre began operating on 3 September 1985. Over the years the number of operations performed has increased considerably. New operating methods have been constantly implemented. The first laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in Bydgoszcz by Dr W. Gontarz (MD, PhD), assisted by the hospital medical staff, on 5 March 1992. Surgeries to follow include thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy performed for the first time in Poland by Dr Krzysztof Leksowski (MD, PhD) in 1997, micro-invasive surgeries of rectal tumours (transanal endoscopic microsurgey - TEM), reflux laparoscopy and thermoablation of metastatic liver tumours. Innovative surgeries, which are the first or among the first surgeries in Poland and in this part of Europe, were performed by Prof. Marek Harat (MD, PhD). <br><br>These include: surgeries performed to remove Parkinson's disease symptoms, implantation of stimulators in infantile cerebral palsy. Neurosurgeons use modern neuronavigation, which allows for the reduction of perioperative injuries of the central nervous system and precise location of pathological lesions. We also perform surgeries to treat mental diseases such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Another Unit to introduce new surgical methods on the Main Operating Theatre is the Urology Clinical Unit. The use of laser allows for lithotripsy, laparoscopic nephrectomy and varicocele surgery which are low-invasive. The progress and development of the scope of surgeries calls for the establishment of new conditions.</p><br>
 
<h6>Cardiosurgery </h6>	 
The Department of Cardiology of the Military Clinical Hospital No. 10 and Polyclinic comprises four units:<br><br>
Invasive Cardiology Clinical Unit – Head of the Unit - Teresa Rusicka – Piekarz, MD <br>
Non-invasive Cardiology and Electrotherapy Clinical Unit – Head of the Unit - Krzysztof Kawecki, MD <br>
Intensive Cardiological Care Clinical Unit – Head of the Unit - Paweł Grzelakowski, MD <br>
Cardiosurgery Clinical Unit – Head of the Unit - Maurycy Missima, MD, PhD <br>
The Department also comprises the following laboratories:<br><br>
Echocardiography Laboratory <br>
Haemodynamics Laboratory <br>
Exercise Test Laboratory <br>
Holter Laboratory <br>
Pacemaker Monitoring Laboratory <br><br>
The Department offers a wide range of medical services:<br>
The Cardiosurgery Clinical Unit performs a full range of heart surgeries, such as mitral valve surgery, aortic valve surgery, aortic aneurysm surgery, congenital heart disease surgery in adults, and surgical treatment of infective endocarditis. <br>
Diagnostics and treatment of circulatory system diseases in adults and early rehabilitation after acute coronary event. <br>
Implantation and monitoring of implanted pacemakers and cardioverters. <br>
Diagnostics and intervention treatment of cardiovascular diseases. <br>
The Department also provides education for medical staff. It also organizes a specialist course for nurses and midwives called “Performing and Interpreting ECG.”</p><br>
<h6>Neurosurgery</h6>
<p>The Department of Neurosurgery performs surgeries for brain tumours, cerebrovascular diseases, craniocerebral injuries, spinal and spinal cord tumours, spinal injuries and degenerative changes, hydrocephalus, peripheral nerve injuries and tumours. Spine surgery and functional surgery are of particular interest. In 1999 we performed the first surgery for Parkinson’s disease.<br><br> We also performed the first in Poland surgery for a mental disease – OCD. To treat spasticity in adults we perform microsurgical DREZ-otomy of cervical and thoracolumbar spine, and peripheral neurotomy. In the treatment of epilepsy we perform temporal lobectomy and implant vagus nerve stimulators.<br><br> As regards spine surgery we perform surgeries for all spine sections, using modern stabilizing systems. In the case of injuries and diseases which disturb the stability of craniocervical junction we perform occipito-cervical stabilization using CCD system. In the cervical spine surgeries we perform intervertebral stabilizations using implants, and in the case of posttraumatic instability - also anterior plates. In advanced multilevel cervical spondylosis with myelopathy we perform a so-called “open door” laminoplasty. <br><br>In the case of thoracic and lumbar sections we use anterior approach through chest or extraperitoneal and posterior approaches. We use anterior and posterior intervertebral cages, vertebral prosthesis, transpedicular stabilizations depending on the levels and causes of instability. As regards the treatment of nervous system tumours we cooperate with the Oncology Centre in Bydgoszcz (in brachytherapy of deeply located glial and metastatic brain tumours). We perform stereotactic brain tumour biopsies and thanks to the cooperation with Dr Tadeusz Szylberg, a neuropathologist, the biopsies are performed during surgery in an operating theatre.<br><br>
The Department possess two air-conditioned operating rooms, equipped with two operating microscopes, ZEISS and MÖLLER - WEDEL with video channel, Valleylab Cusa Excel with anti-gravity head and electrocoagulation, BrainLab set for stereotactic surgeries with program for full-volume image overlapping and planning, system for neuronavigation, a set of tools for microdiscectomy, set for hypophyseal tumour surgery approached from sphenoid sinus, brain endoscope, device for intraoperative USG and X-ray.<br>
In 2003 we purchased a BrainLab system for neuronavigation.</p><br>
 
<h6>Neurology </h6>	 
<p>Since 2000 the Department of Neurology has participated in numerous international studies on new drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. The studies conducted allowed the doctors working at the Department of Neurology to participate in numerous training courses abroad and present their own achievements during scientific conferences, both in Poland and abroad.<br><br>
The Division of Clinical Neurophysiology, thanks to the state-of-the-art equipment, performs the following neurophysiological examinations: evoked potentials, electromyography (EMG, SFEMG), electroencephalography (EEG, mapping, 24-hour EEG recording, video EEG). <br><br>
Presently the scientific research of the Department of Neurology is focused on the participation in international research programmes concerning the introduction of new drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, including evaluation of current drugs which modify the course of this disease as part of the therapy, evaluation of the risk of atheromatosis in the course of ischaemic brain disease and evaluation of the efficacy of new drugs used in the treatment of dementia syndrome, Parkinson's disease and acquired neuropathies.</p><br>
 
<h6>Orthopedics	 </h6>
<p>The Department performs endoprosthetic surgeries, using either cemented and non-cemented prosthesis - primary or revision prosthesis of shoulder joints, elbow joints, hip joints, knee and ankle joints, including surface and short-pin hip joint prosthesis, non-cemented and single-compartment knee joint prosthesis – 320 a year, and joint arthroscopies with ACL plasty, using bioabsorptive pins, and the reconstruction of glenoid labrum of the shoulder joint.<br>
For knee endoprosthetics we use a computer navigation system.<br><br>
Additionally, in the treatment of fractures and complications in the union of broken bones we use GPS II system and biosubstitute bone fillers (Chronos, Calcibone), intramedullar anastomosis, internal stabilizers, LESS, Philos and AO plates.<br><br>
The Department possesses its own operating theatre with two operating rooms, consultation and instructive room, plaster room and two dressing rooms, aseptic and septic.</p><br>
<h6>Urology</h6>
<p>Since the reform of the health service in 1999 the number of hospitalization and surgeries performed has increased considerably. The Unit performs a full range of surgeries, with the exception of the implantation of penis and sphincter prostheses. The first cystectomy was performed at the beginning of the unit activity, ureters using Mauclair method were implanted for the first time in 1987; the first intestinal bladder substitute using Studer method was created in 1995; and the first radical prostatectomy was performed in 1996. The development of low-invasive methods, acquisition of new endoscopic equipment, and the activity forced by the reform brought the changes in the functioning of the Unit. We take on new challenges as regards oncological, endourological and laparoscopic surgeries. The number of patients admitted to hospital increased considerably (around 2,000 hospitalizations); around 1,800 surgeries are performed each year; the hospital stay was shortened to 4 days; treatment procedure standards in accordance with the principles prepared and adopted by the European and Polish Association of Urology are being implemented. The Unit possesses new, air-conditioned, fully equipped endoscopy room. It organizes regular trainings and specialization courses. The Unit meets higher sanitary and epidemiological standards.<br>
Internal diseases <br><br>
The Department of Internal Diseases possesses qualified and integrated team of doctors and nurses, wide diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities.<br><br>
The Department of Internal Diseases has been given accreditation for internal diseases specialization programme. Rapid development of a wide range of diagnostic examinations, endoscopy, biopsy and therapeutic treatments in alimentary tract haemorrhage, cholelithiasis, iatrogenic bile duct injuries and prosthesis fitting, treatment of oesophageal stenosis following inflammation and neoplastic lesions with self-expanding prosthesis, using modern endoscopic equipment, made the Gastroenterology Clinical Unit a perfect candidate to receive accreditation for specialization programme; the Unit became the leading gastroenterology centre of the military health services in the region and throughout Poland.
The Department offers a wide range of medical services:<br><br>
Diagnostics and treatment of deficiency of micro- and macroelements with a particular focus on magnesium deficiency. <br>
Diagnostics and treatment of microcirculation in internal diseases. <br>

<p>The Department of Rehabilitation has 54 beds and treatment facilities which allow for comprehensive rehabilitation of children and adults. The staff consisting of 63 persons fills all positions necessary to carry out the comprehensive rehabilitation programme. The dominant group are outpatients. Each year we receive over 10,000 patients and administer about 1,000,000 treatments. The Department of Rehabilitation offers comprehensive rehabilitation (kinetic, psychological, speech) for adults and children. Extensive treatment facilities as well as skilled and experienced staff guarantee rehabilitation for all patients who need it. Depending on the indications, the treatment is administered in hospital, in one of the three units (Neurological Rehabilitation Unit, Post-traumatic Paraplegia Unit, or Systemic Rehabilitation Unit), on an outpatient basis (Rehabilitation Division) or at patient’s home. The Department rehabilitates patients with neurological (severe spinal and spinal cord traumas, spinal pain, balance disorders, Parkinson’s diseases, MPD), orthopaedic (postoperative and post-traumatic conditions) and rheumatologic diseases.</p> <br>
<h6>Gynaecology</h6> 
<p>The Unit possesses its own operating theatre, treatment room, examination room, ultrasonography room (USG with vaginal head) and urodynamic examination laboratory. The operating theatre is equipped with operating laparoscope with video channel, diagnostic hysteroscope, and two cystoscopes with video channel. The Gynaecology Clinical Unit performs a range of gynaecological surgeries through abdomen, vagina, and using laparoscopy. We use IVS method to treat urinary stress incontinence. We have performed around 200 of such surgeries with very good therapeutic results. In 2004 the Unit was distinguished and received a cup from the Hospital Commandant for the introduction of new operating techniques. Overall, since the beginning the Unit has treated 21,802 patients, delivered 8,541 babies, performed 6,412 serious and 14,542 minor surgeries. The number of surgeries, introduction of new operating techniques and the participation in conferences and training courses help with proper training of doctors who improve their qualifications, and obtain degrees of specialization.</p><br><br>
<h6>Radiology </h6>
<p>The Division of Medical Radiology is one of the most modern institutions in the Polish Army and the macroregion, providing medical services to patients all over Poland. The Division provides 24-hour services to the Hospital and Bydgoszcz, performing 100,000 examinations each year, including 10,000 CT and around 7,000 MR examinations. It performs a variety of interdisciplinary surgeries, in which radiologists play a part, such as diagnostic and therapeutic biopsies, which require X-ray, USG, CT or MR examinations, thermoablation, thermoresection, brain stereotactic surgery, vertebroplasty and other. The Diagnostic and Vascular Intervention Laboratory performs a full range of therapeutic examinations, including the use of modern techniques such as abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (aortic stent-grafts), peripheral stents, intracerebral aneurysm repair, embolization of aneurysms, fistulas, and neoplastic tumours. The magnetic resonance laboratory implements the latest diagnostic procedures, such as: diffusion examinations, perfusion examinations, MR spectroscopy, functional examinations (cortical mapping), whole body and total spine examinations. The advanced system of image processing in computer tomography allows for non-invasive examination of large intestine (virtual colonoscopy), bronchia (virtual bronchoscopy), vessels (peripheral angiography, brain angiography, abdominal vessel angiography, and CT coronarography). The laboratory also performs perfusion examinations of the central nervous system. <br>
In January 2008 the Division purchased the latest AGFA product, IMPAX 6.3, for processing, administration, and distribution of medical data, using digital radiography.</p><br>

The aim of our team is to guarantee your security and care during the entire course of treatment. We offer transport from the airport by minibus or taxi (Mercedes-Benz make). Every time our consultant will help you to choose the most convenient connection to Bydgoszcz including suggestions about a transport company, a flight number and the dates of arrivals and departures. Please be informed that Poland is a part of the European Union, which means that you need to be aware of detailed conditions concerning your arrival in EU. <br><br>

You must be aware that there are no direct flights from U.S. to Bydgoszcz. The most convenient connection is a direct flight to Warsaw (where we can easily pick you up and transport to Bydgoszcz). Such a connection is provided by LOT - Polish Airlines: www.lot.com</p>
