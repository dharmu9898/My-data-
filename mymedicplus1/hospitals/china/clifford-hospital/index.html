		<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 liststyle">
			<p>1) Patient: Mr. Cai, 26 year old, from Hong Kong
In August 2005, Mr. Cai was diagnosed with peculiar anterior mediastinum fibro sarcoma by a Hong Kong hospital. Till then, only 20 cases of this disease were recorded world wide. The only method was to excise it by operation in western medicine. One Hong Kong hospital tried to do the operation, but found the fibro sarcoma was connected with heart, blood vessel and trachea. In this case, it was impossible to have the operation. So they had no other choice but to give up the operation option; moreover radiotherapy could not be carried out because the tumor was too close to the heart.</p><br>

<p>Mr. Cai and his family lost their confidence and he often had fainting spells and even could not take care of himself. One day, a friend recommended our Integrative Green Therapy to him and he was sent to our Oncology Center for treatment. After a specialist panel consultation, an individualized Integrative Green Therapy was offered to him: Medical ozone therapy, detoxification, Chinese medicine, and acupuncture etc. After only half a month, the symptoms of chest pain and fainting spells all disappeared. Now he can take care of himself. After one course of treatment, the CT showed: the tumor had reduced significantly; the pressure on his heart was also reduced. After 3 courses of treatment, his heart function generally recovered. He still comes for regular follow up consultations.</p><br>

<p>2)
Kathy, 59 year old, is from USA. She had mammary gland tumor 4 years ago, and was diagnosed with breast carcinoma 1 year ago. Considering many patients with the same diseases have very bad quality of life and no improvement of life span after treatment by western medicine, she refused to be treated by Western medicine. After some naturopathy in a US hospital, her disease was not getting better. One day, a doctor introduced Kathy to a new method---- Integrative Green Therapy of Clifford Hospital in Guangzhou, China, and heard the effect was very good. After further investigation, she found the method was just in accordance with her treatment requirement, and she found out the phone number from the Internet and contacted our Hospital. On 18th October 2007, the American lady flew into Guangzhou, to our Oncology Center for treatment.</p><br>

<p>Specialists of Clifford Hospital's Oncology Center immediately had a collective consultation. Based on the pathology and after examination by B-ultrasound and CT, she was diagnosed as both sides mammary gland duct carcinoma, lung, liver, and abdomen metastasis, with bilateral pleural effusion. Even though Ms. Kathy was always optimistic, but the reality was the disease was getting worse. The specialist team recommended her an individualized Integrative Green Therapy method: Chinese medicine, acupuncture, medical ozone, detoxification and hyperthermia.</p><br>

<p>After the Integrative Green treatment for more than 40 days, Kathy's disease  was getting much better. Diet and daily activity abilities all improved. The right breast tumor reduced obviously. Left breast tumor became softer. The back metastasis and neck lymph nodes also reduced obviously. The right pleural effusion almost disappeared. The body felt good upon discharge. The first course of treatment was completed successfully. And we suggested that she have a good rest in USA and come back for the second course of treatment in 4 months' time.</p><br>

<p>When leaving our Hospital, Ms. Kathy was moved to cry, and said in Chinese which she just learned: “Good, very good, thank you very much!” and she took photos with the doctors and nurses of our Hospital, and embraced to say goodbye to us.</p><br>

<p>3), Mr. Li, Male, 52 years old, was taken to our Hospital because of chest pains for 3 days and abdominal distention for 1 day on May 13th 2004. <br>

Patient had chest pain, shortness of breath, chills, nausea, vomiting out stomach contents 2 hours after alcohol abuse on 21:00 May 10th 2004. He went to Dongguan Yellow River Hospital, his temperature didn't climb up and this made him feel chilly, HR 26/min, BP undetectable, myocardial enzyme activity enhanced. The diagnosis was "coronary heart disease, acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, atrioventricular block III degree and cardiogenic shock". After normal treatment, the symptoms were relieved and BP rose to 105/64mm Hg. For further treatment, the patient was sent to our Hospital on May 13th 2004.</p><br>


<p>Check-up in Clifford Hospital:<br>
T: 37℃,  P: 45 beats/min,  R: 24 times/min,  BP: 90/58mm Hg, conscious, agitated, obese, <br> slow pulses, distention of jugular vein and positive liver jugular reflux. </p><br>

<p>Diagnosis in Clifford Hospital:<br>
TCM:  Real heart pains <br>
Western medicine:</p> <br>
<p>1. Acute inferior wall and myocardium of right ventricle, myocardial infarction <br>
    Grade III atrioventricular block <br>
    Grade IV heart function</p><br>

<p>2. Pulmonary infection</p> <br>

<p>Consciousness disturbance, delirium, irritability were observed when he was admitted into Clifford Hospital. The examinations showed breath 25 times/min, heart rate ranged from 28 to 45 beats/min, blood pressure 85/55 to 102/66mm Hg. The coronary angiography showed: pathological changes of three branches and right coronary occlusion where no blood flowed through. We carried out PCI therapy and the surgery was smooth. The angiography after PCI showed no narrowing. Atrioventricular block turned from type III to type II; ventricle rate 55-72 beats/min. The patient was still unconsciousness and delirious, under which state we could only treat him with integrated therapies of Traditional Chinese and Western medicine. During the recovery treatment period on May 20, 2004, atrioventricular block deteriorated to type III, with no repeated ventricular and A-S syndrome, cardiac arrest occurred twice. We implanted temporary pacemaker after recovery and applied tracheotomy ventilator machine to assist breathing due to breathing difficulties. On May 21 2004, patient recovered sinus rhythm. On May 22, the patient gradually regained consciousness and we stopped the tracheotomy machine. On May 26, 2004, the temporary pacing electrode and tracheotomy tube were removed. He continued to accept comprehensive treatment such as Chinese Medicine, Western Medicine and nutrition diet. On June 18, 2004, Mr Li was discharged.</p><br>

<p>In this case, the patient had massive acute myocardial infarction and many complications had appeared:  Atrioventricular block of III degree three times, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary infection etc. The patient was treated by comprehensive therapy integrating modern medical thromblysis, interventional therapy, implanting pacemakers, endotracheal intubation breathing machine, injection of Traditional Chinese medicines Shengmai and Xiangdan, and at the same time, assisted by nutritional diet and Alternative Medicines. With this therapy, he could pull through death.</p>
